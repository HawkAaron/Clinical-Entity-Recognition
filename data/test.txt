Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Initial
A/P
:

71
y/o
male
with
dm2
,
cad
,
chf
,
uc
presents
with
one
week
of
lower
abdominal
pain
and
2
episodes
of
brpbr
on
the
day
of
admission
.

#
BRBPR
--
The
patient
was
in
the
intensive
care
unit
given
his
lower
GI
bleed
.

An
angiography
showed
bleeding
in
two
vessels
off
of
the
Minnie
supplying
the
sigmoid
that
were
succesfully
embolized
.

The
patient
was
transfused
from
a
Hct
29
to
34
on
the
day
of
discharge
.

His
coumadin
was
held
during
his
stay
given
his
acute
bleed
but
restarted
per
his
PCP
with
the
guidance
of
GI
on
the
day
of
discharge
.

-
The
patient
underwent
a
flex
sigmoidoscopy
on
Friday
,
11-02
,
which
showed
old
blood
in
the
rectal
vault
but
no
active
source
of
bleeding
.

Given
this
,
it
was
advised
that
the
patient
have
a
colonoscopy
to
rule
out
further
bleeding
.

-
The
patient
had
a
colonoscopy
on
Monday
11-05
but
unfortunately
,
was
unable
to
complete
the
study
as
his
bowel

prep
was
inadequate
.

Therefore
,
he
had
a
repeat
colonoscopy
on
11-06
which
showed
expected
mucosal
signs
of
moderate
ulcerative
colitis
,
no
polyps
,
w/
8
mm
ulcer
at
junction
of
distal
descending
colon
and
sigmoid
colon
.

-
Biopsies
were
obtained
during
his
colonoscopy
and
he
should
follow
up
with
gastroenterology
for
the
results
.

#
Ulcerative
colitis
--
The
patient
's
Asacol
was
originally
held
but
restarted
the
day
prior
to
discharge
per
GI
.

#
CAD/CHF
-
The
patient
was
restarted
on
his
home
regimen
prior
to
discharge
as
it
was
held
temporarily
given
his
acute
GI
bleed
.

The
exception
is
that
per
his
PCP
,
Jason
aspirin
will
be
held
for
2
weeks
given
that
he
was
restarted
on
coumadin
with

his
risk
of
bleeding
.

#
DM-2
--
The
patient
was
maintained
on
his
home
insulin
regimen
.

#
h/o
DVT/PE
:

Coumadin
was
initially
held
.

It
was
unclear
at
first
as
to
why
the
patient
required
life-long
anticoagulation
.

After
discussing
this
with
his
PCP
,
Leon
was
clear
that
the
patient
had
had
recurrent
DVTs
and
ultimately
a
PE
and
his
PCP
felt
strongly
that
he
required
long-term
anticoagulation
.

His
goal
INR
should
be
1.6-2.0
.
If
bleeding
continues
to
occur
,
consider
V.
Winchester
filter
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
28-year-old
woman
who
is
HIV
positive
for
two
years
.

She
presented
with
left
upper
quadrant
pain
as
well
as
nausea
and
vomiting
which
is
a
long-standing
complaint
.

She
was
diagnosed
in
1991
during
the
birth
of
her
child
.

She
claims
she
does
not
know
why
she
is
HIV
positive
.

She
is
from
Maryland
,
apparently
had
no
blood
transfusions
before
the
birth
of
her
children
so
it
is
presumed
heterosexual
transmission
.

At
that
time
,
she
also
had
cat
scratch
fever
and
she
had
resection
of
an
abscess
in
the
left
lower
extremity
.

She
has
not
used
any
anti
retroviral
therapy
since
then
,
because
of
pancytopenia
and
vomiting
on
DDI
.

She
has
complaints
of
nausea
and
vomiting
as
well
as
left
upper
quadrant
pain
on
and
off
getting
progressively
worse
over
the
past
month
.

She
has
had
similar
pain
intermittently
for
last
year
.

She
described
the
pain
as
a
burning
pain
which
is
positional
,
worse
when
she
walks
or
does
any
type
of
exercise
.

She
has
no
relief
from
antacids
or
H2
blockers
.

In
10/92
,
she
had
a
CT
scan
which
showed
fatty
infiltration
of
her
liver
diffusely
with
a
1
cm
cyst
in
the
right
lobe
of
the
liver
.

She
had
a
normal
pancreas
at
that
time
,
however
,
hyperdense
kidneys
.

Her
alkaline
phosphatase
was
slightly
elevated
but
otherwise
relatively
normal
.

Her
amylase
was
mildly
elevated
but
has
been
down
since
then
.

The
patient
has
had
progressive
failure
to
thrive
and
steady
weight
loss
.

She
was
brought
in
for
an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy
on
9/26
but
she
basically
was
not
sufficiently
sedated
and
readmitted
at
this
time
for
a
GI
work-up
as
well
as
an
evaluation
of
new
abscess
in
her
left
lower
calf
and
right
medial
lower
extremity
quadriceps
muscle
.

She
was
also
admitted
to
be
connected
up
with
social
services
for
HIV
patients
.

year
.

In
the
Emergency
Department
,
she
had
labile
blood
pressure
with
systolic
blood
pressure
in
the
80
s
.

Her
usual
is
systolic
blood
pressure
in
the
120
s
,
this
was
despite
two
liters
of
intravenous
fluids
and
she
was
transferred
to
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
closer
monitoring
for
possible
early
sepsis
.

The
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
was
notable
for
initially
receiving
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
as
well
as
a
white
blood
cell
count
of
11.0
with
15
bands
.

She
was
ultimately
changed
to
Levaquin
for
a
possible
early
pneumonia
pending
cultures
.

The
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
was
also
notable
for
negative
chest
x-ray
,
two
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
for
a
hematocrit
of
24.0
with
appropriate
bump
in
her
hematocrit
and
no
evidence
of
bleeding
,
stable
blood
pressure
despite
a
net
fluid
balance
of
negative
2.5
liters
.

No
central
access
was
needed
.

The
sepsis
protocol
was
aborted
.

Also
of
note
,
her
liver
function
tests
had
been
normal
.

Random
cortisol
was
17
and
her
DFA
was
positive
for
influenzae
A
with
a
viral
culture
pending
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

Blood
and
urine
cultures
were
no
growth
at
the
time
of
discharge
as
well
.

She
also
had
a
right
lower
extremity
noninvasive
ultrasound
that
was
negative
for
deep
venous
thrombosis
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

This
is
an
80
year
old
female
with
a
history
of
Stage
I
breast
cancer
,
hypertension
,
hyperlipidemia
,
who
presents
with
a
leukocytosis/bandemia
,
hypotension
in
the
setting
of
dehydration
and
influenza
.

After
a
short
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
where
she
remained
hemodynamically
stable
,
she
was
transferred
to
the
floor
.

Gerardi
problem
list
is
as
follows
:

Hypotension
-
This
was
likely
secondary
to
volume
depletion
in
the
setting
of
a
diarrheal
and
viral
respiratory
syndrome
.

Her
blood
pressure
was
stable
after
three
liters
of
normal
saline
.

She
was
clinically
euvolemic
after
that
.

She
did
receive
two
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
.

There
is
no
evidence
of
gastrointestinal
bleed
or
adrenal
insufficiency
during
the
course
of
her
evaluation
.

Her
antihypertensives
were
initially
held
and
reinstated
upon
discharge
.

Influenza
A
-
DFA
confirmed
,
the
viral
cultures
were
pending
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

The
initial
bandemia
would
not
have
been
consistent
with
a
typical
influenza
presentation
,
so
she
was
continued
on
a
fourteen
day
course
of
Levaquin
to
eliminate
any
possibility
of
a
bacterial
superinfection
or
early
pneumonia
.

Loose
bowel
movements
-
This
problem
was
resolved
and
had
been
a
viral
syndrome
on
presentation
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
diarrhea
during
medical
Lawrence
Memorial
Hospital
stay
.

Anemia
-
This
is
a
chronic
problem
.

She
has
known
iron
deficiency
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
bleeding
.

She
was
guaiac
negative
and
the
Hemophilus
panel
was
negative
.

She
was
reinstated
on
iron
at
discharge
and
her
hematocrit
was
stable
.

Hypothyroid
-
She
was
continued
on
her
Synthroid
.

Osteopenia
-
She
was
continued
on
Evista
.

Fluids
,
electrolytes
and
nutrition
-
She
was
tolerating
a
house
diet
upon
discharge
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
and
OUTCOME
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
cardiology
service
and
commenced
amiodarone
loading
.

Adenosine
stress
MIBI
revealed
a
small
reversible
defect
in
the
PDA
territory
and
the
patient
underwent
coronary
catheterisation
on
1/6/0004
which
revealed
a
70%
lesion
in
the
SVG
to
PDA
->
cypher
stented
successfully
.

He
had
occasional
ventricular
extopyon
telemetry
but
no
further
recurrence
of
ventricular
tachycardia
.

During
his
admission
,
his
am
fasting
glucose
levels
were
intermittently
elevated
and
his
HbA1C
was
greater
than
7
.

I
have
explained
to
him
that
he
may
have
developed
some
glucose
intolerance
and
that
,
in
the
first
instance
,
he
should
see
his
Primary
Care
Physician
and
attempt
dietary
control
.

On
the
day
prior
to
discharge
he
noticed
a
small
area
of
erythema
surrounding
his
R
antecubital
venous
access
site
.

This
will
be
treated
empirically
with
a
10
day
course
of
Keflex
.

I
have
instructed
him
to
see
his
PCP
if
it
does
not
improve
in
a
few
days
or
if
he
develops
fevers
.

In
terms
of
his
amiodarone
,
he
will
be
discharged
on
400mg
po
bid
for
a
further
7
days
followed
by
400mg
qd
thereafter
.

He
will
followup
with
Dr.
Levels
in
device
clinic
in
4
weeks
.

I
have
advised
him
that
he
must
not
drive
until
he
is
seena
gain
in
clinic
and
his
device
interrogated
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

This
62
year-old
obese
male
was
admitted
with
cellulitis
and
presumed
bacteremia
.

In
the
John
,
he
was
found
to
be
in
hypotensive
atrial
fibrillation
.

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Medical
ICU
where
his
hypotension
was
managed
with
IVF
hydration
and
he
was
maintained
on
a
diltiazam
drip
for
atrial
fibrillation
.

After
his
heart
rate
was
controlled
,
he
was
transitioned
to
oral
medications
and
transferred
to
the
medicine
service
.

1.
Cellulitis
/
Bacteremia

Review
of
the
medical
record
revealed
several
previous
admissions
for
cellulitis
and
bacteremia
.

Blood
cultures
on
this
admission
and
were
positive
for
Beta
streptococcus
Group
B
.

The
patient
had
previous
episodes
of
the
same
infection
,
with
lower
extremity
cellulitis
the
likely
source
.

A
left
lower
extremity
ultrasound
was
negative
for
deep
venous
thrombosis
.

The
patient
was
too
large
to
have
a
CTA
.

He
was
initially
treated
with
vancomycin
and
zosyn
while
awaiting
culture
results
.

Once
the
organism
was
identified
,
he
was
transitioned
to
a
regimen
of
intravenous
penicillin
and
oral
levofloxacin
,
which
had
successfully
treated
the
infection
during
his
most
recent
admission
1
year
prior
.

He
completed
7
days
of
levofloxacin
and
had
a
PICC
line
placed
to
facilitate
a
2
week
course
of
IV
Penicillin
.

2.
Atrial
fibrillation

The
patient
's
development
of
atrial
fibrillation
was
believed
to
be
secondary
to
infection
and
structural
heart
disease
.

It
was
initially
managed
with
intravenous
diltiazam
,
and
it
was
later
managed
with
metoprolol
and
anticoagulation
.

A
transthoracic
echocardiogram
showed
a
mildly
dilated
and
elongated
left
atrium
,
with
a
markedly
dilated
right
atrium
.

He
had
occasional
episodes
of
rapid
atrial
fibrillation
that
were
controlled
with
responded
to
IV
metoprolol
.

However
,
his
rate
proved
difficult
to
control
despite
metoprolol
and
diltiazam
.

The
EP
service
was
consulted
and
recommended
transesophageal
echocardiogram
and
cardioversion
.

The
TEE
was
negative
for
thrombus
and
the
patient
was
successfully
cardioverted
to
normal
sinus
rhythm
with
ibutilide
.

He
was
subsequently
started
on
amiodarone
and
is
scheduled
to
complete
a
10
week
course
.

EKG
before
discharge
showed
mild
QT
prolongation
and
no
effect
from
amiodarone
.

EKG
and
LFTs
should
be
monitored
by
his
PCP
,
William
given
the
high
dose
of
amiodarone
he
will
receive
.

3.
FEN

He
was
followed
by
the
nutrition
team
throughout
his
admission
and
their
recommendations
were
followed
.

He
demonstrated
several
asymptomatic
electrolyte
deficiecies
;
these
were
likely
due
to
inadequate
absorption
following
his
surgery
and
he
responded
well
to
repletion
.

Vitamin
D
and
parathyroid
tests
were
pending
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

The
patient
was
discharged
to
Kindred
Park
View
Specialty
Hospital
of
Springfield
Rehabilitation
Hospital
in
good
condition
.

He
was
sent
with
a
King
of
Hearts
monitor
and
scheduled
for
follow-up
with
cardiology
and
his
primary
care
physician
.

was
admitted
to
the
Tau
Memorial
Hospital
.

She
was
seen
by
Dr.
Freiermthalskush
of
the
renal
service
for
management
of
her
chronic
renal
insufficiency
.

On
02/22
,
she
underwent
angiography
,
which
revealed
minimal
right
internal
carotid
artery
disease
,
and
proximal
left
internal
carotid
artery
stenosis
,
2
cm
in
length
for
the
1
mm
residual
lumen
.

The
left
anterior
communicating
artery
fell
from
the
right
.

She
was
also
seen
by
Cardiology
,
and
she
underwent
cardiac
catheterization
,
as
part
of
her
preop
evaluation
,
which
revealed
normal
resting
hemodynamics
,
and
a
moderate
posterior
descending
artery
,
and
obtuse
marginal
stenoses
.

She
was
,
therefore
,
cleared
for
the
operating
room
,
and
on
3/3/92
,
she
underwent
a
left
carotid
endarterectomy
,
with
continuous
electroencephalogram
monitoring
and
vein
patch
angioplasty
,
which
was
uneventful
.

Her
postoperative
course
was
marked
only
by
prolonged
ileus
,
perhaps
secondary
to
constipation
,
with
persistent
vomiting
,
requiring
intravenous
fluids
,
however
,
on
03/07/92
,
she
had
a
large
bowel
movement
,
after
aggressive
bowel
regime
,
felt
significantly
better
,
was
able
to
tolerate
PO
&apos;s
.

She
is
now
able
to
be
discharged
home
on
her
admission
medications
,
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
Vasotec
was
increased
to

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
on
07/20/99
for
a
history
of
left
chest
wall
pain
from
postthoracotomy
syndrome
.

The
patient
developed
the
syndrome
after
her
thoracic
aortic
aneurysm
repair
.

The
patient
failed
the
conservative
therapy
and
is
admitted
for
a
spinal
cord
stimulator
trial
.

The
patient
had
a
spinal
cord
stimulator
placed
on
07/21/99
.

She
underwent
the
procedure
and
tolerated
the
procedure
very
well
.

The
spinal
cord
stimulator
was
programmed
with
setting
of
a
rate
of
80
,
power
450
and
4.0
amps
.

Channel
1
was
negative
,
2
was
neutral
,
3
was
neutral
,
4
was
positive
.

The
patient
the
next
two
days
did
not
notice
any
significant
change
in
her
pain
pattern
.

The
patient
was
also
noted
to
have
a
lot
of
musculoskeletal
component
of
her
pain
.

So
,
an
epidural
catheter
was
placed
on
07/23/99
.

The
epidural
was
placed
in
the
L1-2
region
and
the
catheter
was
placed
in
the
T7
region
using
fluoroscope
to
guide
the
catheter
.

Within
the
next
couple
of
days
,
the
patient
noticed
a
significant
improvement
in
her
pain
pattern
.

The
stabbing
,
sharp
pain
that
she
occasionally
has
on
the
left
chest
wall
was
significantly
diminished
and
she
also
noticed
periods
of
time
when
she
did
not
have
any
of
that
pain
.

The
epidural
catheter
had
a
morphine
infusion
initially
started
at
1
mg
a
day
and
increased
to
3
mg
a
day
in
a
period
of
three
days
.

The
epidural
was
discontinued
on
07/26/99
and
was
considered
a
successful
trial
.

The
patient
will
schedule
with
the
Pain
Clinic
regarding
upcoming
epidural
pump
placement
.

During
her
hospitalization
,
the
patient
was
also
seen
by
the
Plastic
Service
.

Dr.
Falccouette
would
like
to
perform
an
excision
and
closure
flap
of
her
left
ischial
decubitusin
the
near
future
.

The
patient
was
discharged
in
stable
conditionand
will
follow
up
for
(
1
)
sacral
decubitus
closure
,
and
(

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
75
year
old
male
had
been
noted
to
be
anemic
with
an
abnormal
white
blood
count
since
at
least
November
1993
,
while
he
was
living
in
Aersing
Rocuch
Sun
and
his
physicians
there
had
begun
to
manage
him
with
transfusions
,
and
low
dose
hydroxyurea
.

Apparently
,
a
bone
marrow
biopsy
at
the
time
confirmed
the
diagnosis
of
chronic
myelomonocytic
leukemia
.

He
came
to
this
country
in
late
December
1994
to
live
with
his
son
for
a
few
months
and
was
referred
to
me
for
follow
up
.

He
had
been
noting
night
sweats
,
increasing
fatigue
,
anorexia
,
and
dyspnea
,
which
were
not
particularly
improved
by
increased
transfusions
or
alterations
of
hydroxy
urea
.

He
became
profoundly
thrombocytopenic
,
and
ultimately
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
on
2/15
with
headache
and
weakness
.

PAST
MEDICAL
HISTORY
:

Significant
for
chronic
atrial
fibrillation
,
managed
with
an
Italian
variation
of
Digoxin
,
and
Amioadrone
,
hypertension
managed
with
an
ACE
inhibitor
,
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
managed
with
a
zanthine
preparation
and
low
dose
steroids
,
as
well
as
an
occasional
inhaler
.

Other
medical
problems
included
chronic
liver
disease
of
uncertain
etiology
,
for
which
he
had
been
advised
not
to
drink
any
alcohol
.

He
also
had
a
penetrating
injury
to
the
right
eye
,
which
had
rendered
him
blind
10
years
previously
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

He
was
a
chronically
ill
appearing
elderly
man
,
with
a
respiratory
rate
of
30
,
temperature
99.6
,
pulse
100
,
and
irregularly
irregular
,
blood
pressure
148/71
.

He
had
some
petechiae
on
his
extremities
,
as
well
as
in
his
mucosal
membranes
with
some
hemorrhagic
bullae
.

There
were
bibasilar
rales
with
some
wheezing
.

He
had
no
cardiac
murmur
.

His
abdomen
was
distended
with
massive
hepatosplenomegaly
,
which
was
somewhat
tender
.

The
neurological
examination
aside
from
the
blind
right
eye
was
unremarkable
.

LABORATORY
DATA
:

Included
a
white
blood
count
of
140,000
,
7%
polys
,
1%
bands
,
3%
lymphs
,
1%
monos
,
2
basos
,
4
blasts
,
76%
pearl
monocytes
,
6%
meta
&apos;s
,
3
nucleated
red
blood
cells
.

There
were
some
oval
tear
drop
cells
and
target
cells
with
a
few
schistocytes
.

The
platelet
count
was
9,000
,
hematocrit
was
26.5
,
with
an
mean
corpuscular
volume
of
about
73
.

His
prothrombin
time
and
partial
thromboplastin
time
were
normal
.

His
uric
acid
was
up
at
97
,
his
total
bilirubin
was
up
at
1.8
,
his
LDH
was
428
,
his
phosphorus
was
1.2
,
calcium
8.6
,
Digoxin
level
was
1.0
,
potassium
on
admission
was
2.9
,
sodium
135
,
BUN
and
creatinine
13/1.6
,
and
sugar
of
267
.

A
computerized
tomography
scan
of
his
head
showed
no
signs
of
an
acute
bleed
,
a
chest
X-ray
showed
no
new
infiltrates
or
masses
.

There
was
cardiomegaly
with
prominent
vascularity
,
but
no
effusions
.

An
electrocardiogram
was
consistent
with
atrial
fibrillation
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
and
begun
on
high
dose
Hydroxyurea
,
with
a
gradual
improvement
in
his
white
blood
count
over
the
next
few
days
.

He
did
spike
a
fever
and
began
Ancef
and
Gentamicin
,
although
cultures
never
revealed
a
source
for
this
.

He
also
tried
Amicar
and
continued
on
low
dose
Prednisone
.

His
headache
improved
,
but
her
remained
profoundly
weak
and
intermittently
febrile
with
dyspnea
.

There
was
hemoptysis
and
intermittent
gastrointestinal
bleeding
,
while
he
remained
profoundly
thrombocytopenia
.

Transfusions
of
platelets
did
not
change
his
platelet
count
,
presumably
because
of
sequestration
and
a
massive
spleen
.

Amicar
was
of
uncertain
value
,
but
used
intermittently
.

A
bone
marrow
biopsy
revealed
the
transformation
of
his
CMML
to
acute
myelogenous
leukemia
,
and
given
his
other
underlying
medical
problems
,
we
chose
chemotherapy
with
subcutaneous
Cystosine
Arabinoside
and
6-Thioguanine
,
which
he
tolerated
without
incident
and
this
brought
his
white
blood
count
down
to
below
1,000
,
and
his
spleen
shrank
noticeably
,
but
he
still
could
not
maintain
a
bump
in
platelet
count
with
platelet
transfusions
.

He
was
intermittently
congested
limiting
our
ability
to
give
intravenous
fluid
,
for
his
hydrea
,
although
we
kept
him
on
Allopurinol
.

The
renal
function
deteriorated
somewhat
,
hampering
our
ability
to
give
him
his
Gentamicin
.

The
family
maintained
an
extraordinary
vigil
over
the
days
of
his
hospitalization
,
providing
him
with
some
food
and
constant
attention
,
while
we
awaited
the
results
of
his
chemotherapy
and
treatment
of
his
infection
.

He
was
intermittently
restless
and
somewhat
confused
,
and
as
his
respiratory
status
deteriorated
,
the
family
agreed
to
a
low
dose
Morphine
drip
which
made
him
much
more
comfortable
.

They
agreed
with
a
do
not
resuscitate
status
early
on
in
the
hospitalization
and
in
the
course
of
being
maintain
on
low
dose
Morphine
,
he
ultimately
expired
on
2/28/94
with
the
family
present
.

No
autopsy
was
obtained
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Patient
is
a
28
year
old
gravida
IV
,
para
2
with
metastatic
cervical
cancer
admitted
with
a
question
of
malignant
pericardial
effusion
.

Patient
underwent
a
total
abdominal
hysterectomy
in
02/90
for
a
4x3.6x2
cm
cervical
mass
felt
to
be
a
fibroid
at
Vanor
.

Pathology
revealed
poorly
differentiated
squamous
cell
carcinoma
of
the
cervix
with
spots
of
vaginal
margins
and
metastatic
squamous
cell
carcinoma
in
the
cardinal
ligaments
with
extensive
lymphatic
invasion
.

Patient
was
felt
to
have
stage
2B
disease
and
post-operatively
,
she
was
treated
with
intracavitary
and
external
beam
radiation
therapy
and
low
dose
Cisplatin
.

On
ultrasound
in
02/91
,
the
patient
was
found
to
have
bilateral
cystic
adnexal
masses
confirmed
on
physical
examination
.

She
underwent
exploratory
laparotomy
and
had
a
bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy
and
appendectomy
.

Pathology
was
negative
for
tumor
and
showed
peritubal
and
periovarian
adhesions
.

The
patient
now
presents
with
a
three
to
four
week
history
of
shortness
of
breath
and
a
dry
non-productive
cough
.

She
was
evaluated
by
Dr.
Mielke
,
a
Pulmonologist
,
who
found
her
to
be
wheezing
and
performed
pulmonary
function
tests
which
showed
an
FEV1
of
1.1
and
an
FVC
of
1.8
.

She
was
admitted
to
Weekscook
University
Medical
Center
with
a
diagnosis
of
possible
asthma
.

Room
air
arterial
blood
gas
showed
a
pO2
of
56
,
a
pCO2
of
35
,
and
a
pH
of
7.52
.

EKG
showed
sinus
tachycardia
at
100
and
echo
revealed
pericardial
effusion
,
a
10
mm
pulsus
paradoxus
was
noted
,
and
no
evidence
of
tamponade
.

Given
the
patient
&apos;s
history
of
cervical
cancer
,
the
pericardial
effusion
was
felt
most
likely
to
be
malignant
.

She
was
therefore
transferred
to
the
Retelk
County
Medical
Center
for
further
care
.

of
723,000
.

PT

Electrolytes
were
within

tests
within
normal
limits
,
and
EKG
showed
a
heart
rate
of
128
,
axis
73
,
and
possible
ectopic
P
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
for
a
new
pericardial
effusion
which
was
felt
most
likely
to
be
secondary
to
metastatic
cervical
cancer
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
tamponade
.

An
echocardiogram
was
scheduled
and
Cardiology
was
consulted
.

Echocardiogram
showed
moderate
anterior
pericardial
effusion
of
approximately
600
cc
with
diastolic
indications
of
the
right
ventricle
and
low
velocity
paradox
.

Cardiology
did
not
feel
that
tamponade
at
this
time
was
a
concern
and
that
a
tap
need
not
be
performed
.

She
continued
to
have
pulmonary
wheezing
,
unknown
origin
,
without
history
of
asthma
.

Her
steroids
were
tapered
and
Pulmonary
was
consulted
who
recommended
a
CT
scan
of
the
chest
to
evaluate
the
lung
parenchyma
,
induce
sputum
for
CBC
,
arterial
blood
gas
,
continuing
of
the
beta
agonist
inhalers
,
and
trial
of
steroid
inhalers
.

They
felt
it
was
most
likely
a
malignant
lymphangitic
spread
with
pericardial
involvement
versus
infectious
,
other
cardiovascular
causes
,
or
viral
bronchiolitis
.

She
had
pulmonary
function
tests
repeated
which
showed
an
FEV1
of
36%
of
predicted
and
FVC
of
56%
of
predicted
.

Room
air
arterial
blood
gas
showed
a
pH
of
7.45
,
pO2
of
63
,
a
pCO2
of
41
,
and
fairly
significant
AA
gradient
.

She
was
continued
on
two
liters
of
oxygen
awaiting
her
CT
scan
on
06/14
and
she
developed
a
new
junctional
rhythm
with
a
question
of
a
new
rub
versus
murmur
on
examination
.

Cardiology
felt
she
had
a
rub
and
her
pulsus
was
still
10
.

EKG
showed
an
ectopic
low
atrial
P
and
they
thought
she
was
still
stable
without
evidence
of
tamponade
.

She
should
have
a
follow-up
echocardiogram
.

Echocardiogram
showed
left
ventricle
at
the
upper
limits
of
normal
for
size
,
low
normal
function
,
moderate
to
mild
effusion
with
pericardial
pressures
exceeding
right
atrial
pressures
,
and
right
ventricular
pressures
at
various
points
of
patient
&apos;s
cycle
without
any
change
in
the
effusion
from
06/11
.

Thoracic
Surgery
was
also
consulted
and
they
felt
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
pericardial
window
at
the
time
.

She
should
be
continued
with
pulmonary
oximetry
testing
.

She
underwent
her
CT
scan
.

This
showed
lymphangitic
spread
of
cancer
in
the
chest
,
question
of
pulmonary
nodules
in
the
chest
,
pericardial
effusion
,
multiple
liver
metastases
,
decreased
function
of
the
left
kidney
,
dilated
left
intrarenal
collecting
system
and
proximal
ureter
,
and
periaortic
lymphadenopathy
.

Pulmonary
felt
this
was
consistent
also
with
lymphangitic
spread
and
they
did
not
feel
that
a
bronchoscopy
would
be
of
any
assistance
at
this
time
.

Chemotherapy
for
metastatic
cervical
cancer
was
discussed
with
the
patient
and
she
was
started
on
5-FU
800
mg
per
meter
squared
days
06/18
,
06/19
,
and
06/20
.

She
also
received
Cisplatin
35
per
meter
squared
on
06/19
and
Ifex
and
Mesna
on
06/18
.

She
was
noted
,
on
06/16
,
to
have
numerous
erythematous
maculopapules
on
her
back
and
chest
.

Dermatology
was
consulted
and
they
felt
that
this
was
most
likely
steroid
acne
.

They
therefore
felt
a
rapid
steroid
taper
was
indicated
and
topical
Erythromycin
if
desired
by
the
patient
.

The
patient
&apos;s
shortness
of
breath
and
wheezing
continued
but
without
change
.

Her
cardiac
examination
remained
the
same
and
there
continued
to
be
no
evidence
of
tamponade
.

Cardiology
felt
that
follow-up
echo
was
indicated
on
06/18
as
she
had
another
echocardiogram
which
showed
no
change
or
evidence
of
tamponade
.

They
therefore
felt
that
she
could
be
continued
to
be
followed
by
examination
.

She
had
some
mental
status
changes
with
confusion
and
hallucinations
on
06/18
originating
from
narcotics
versus
decreased
pO2
.

The
Ifex
was
held
as
it
was
felt
that
it
could
have
precipitated
the
mental
status
changes
and
that
she
was
to
receive
no
further
Ifex
.

She
had
no
further
hallucinations
since
stopping
the
Ifex
.

Psychiatry
was
also
consulted
to
help
her
with
the
changes
she
was
feeling
since
her
new
diagnosis
.

She
was
hooked
up
with
support
services
in
Collot
Ln
,
Dugo
,
Indiana
68961
for
further
counselling
and
given
Xanax
for
symptoms
of
anxiety
.

She
continued
to
have
no
change
in
her
shortness
of
breath
or
cardiac
examination
and
was
discharged
home
on
06/22/91
after
completing
her
5-FU
and
Cisplatin
chemotherapy
.

She
will
be
followed

Pt
reports
that
he
noticed
a
right
neck
mass
last
October
.

The
mass
grew
larger
,
to
the
size
of
a
baseball
.

It
appears
that
FNA
was
performed
but
was
non-diagnostic
(
probably
because
anaplastic
tumors
tend
to
be
necrotic
)
.

The
mass
appears

be
cystic

Pathology
:

The
tumor
is
composed
of
a
relatively
monotonous
proliferation
of
spindle
cells
which
grow
in
sheets
with
a
prominent
vascular
pattern
.

.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Pt
was
transferred
here
for
further
mgmt
of
airway
and
large
thyroid
mass
by
our
IP
team
.

IP
found
endotracheal
obstructing
tumor
and
extrinsic
compression
of
the
high
trachea
by
thyroid
mass
.

After
rigid
bronchoscopy
with
removal
of
the
intratracheal
tumor
component
on
2018-04-24
,
stat
pathology
showed
anaplastic
tumor
.

He
was
tranferred
to
the
CMED
.

Subsequently
extubated
and
his
respiratory
Sx
are
now
improved
.

Pt
was
seen
by
Rad
Onc
,
who
recommended
transfer
to
the
East
Campus
for
XRT
.

On
the
morning
of
possible
radiation
,
patient
and
family
met
with
interventional
pulmonary
team
who
explained
that
the
most

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

On
admission
,
the
patient
was
diagnosed
with
acute
pancreatitis
.

He
was
made
NPO
and
was
resuscitated
with
IV
fluids
.

Pain
control
was
initiated
with
morphine
but
was
then
changed
to
Demerol
,
which
gave
the
patient
better
relief
of
his
epigastric
pain
.

From
2/17/00
to
2/21/00
,
the
patient
complained
of
persistent
and
occasionally
severe
epigastric
pain
.

His
pain
medication
was
then
changed
to
Dilaudid
IV
in
an
attempt
to
better
alleviate
his
symptoms
.

Dilaudid
IV
was
continued
for
the
remainder
of
the
patient
&apos;s
hospitalization
.

The
does
was
titrated
to
the
patient
&apos;s
need
for
comfort
and
was
eventually
tapered
.

The
severity
and
persistent
of
the
patient
&apos;s
epigastric
pain
was
concerning
for
a
pancreatic
complication
such
as
necrosis
or
abscess
.

The
patient
had
a
CT
scan
,
which
revealed
a
mass
in
the
gallbladder
neck
,
but
no
biliary
dilatation
.

There
was
stranding
along
the
pancreas
,
but
no
necrosis
,
abscess
,
or
pseudocyst
.

On
2/22/00
,
the
patient
had
fevers
to
103.5
.

Blood
and
urine
cultures
were
sent
.

A
chest
x-ray
was
done
,
which
revealed
no
infiltrate
or
effusion
.

The
patient
was
started
on
cefotaxime
1
gm
IV
for
empiric
antibiotic
treatment
.

All
cultures
were
negative
.

On
2/23/00
,
the
high
grade
fever
persisted
.

An
ultrasound
was
done
to
R
/
O
cholestasis
or
cholangitis
.

The
ultrasound
showed
biliary
sludge
and
swelling
of
the
body
and
tail
of
the
pancreas
.

No
other
abnormalities
were
noted
.

On
2/24/00
,
the
patient
had
an
episode
of
exacerbation
of
epigastric
pain
with
radiation
to
the
left
upper
quadrant
.

The
pain
was
subsequently
relieved
with
high
dose
Dilaudid
.

The
patient
had
a
follow-up
chest
x-ray
,
which
was
essentially
unchanged
from
previously
,
showing
a
normal
heart
and
lungs
without
infiltrate
.

From
2/25
-
2/27/00
,
the
patient
&apos;s
fever
defervesced
and
his
abdominal
pain
gradually
subsided
.

The
cefotaxime
was
discontinued
since
no
infection
was
identified
.

On
2/28/00
,
the
patient
&apos;s
diet
was
advanced
to
a
low
fat
solids
(
per
pancreatitis
study
)
,
which
the
patient
tolerated
well
.

The
patient
was
discharged
home
on
2/29/00
,
with
much
improvement
of
his
symptoms
.

.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
ON
ADMISSION
:

Physical
examination
at
the
time
of
admission
revealed
she
was
in
no
acute
distress
.

Blood
pressure
was
150/79
,
a
pulse
of
81
.

She
is
legally
blind
.

She
was
without
any
adenopathy
.

Her
chest
was
clear
to
auscultation
.

Heart
had
a
normal
S1
and
S2
,
with
no
murmurs
,
gallops
or
rubs
.

Her
abdomen
was
soft
with
well-healed
incisions
.

There
was
no
organomegaly
.

Extremities
were
without
edema
.

She
had
a
functioning
arteriovenous
fistula
with
a
thrill
and
a
bruit
in
her
left
arm
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
preoperative
holding
area
and
taken
electively
to
the
operating
room
.

She
underwent
a
living-related
renal
transplant
in
the
right
iliac
fossa
.

The
operation
was
somewhat
technically
difficult
secondary
to
a
short
segment
of
ureter
which
was
anastomosed
over
a
stent
to
the
bladder
.

Otherwise
,
there
were
difficulties
,
and
estimated
blood
loss
was
minimal
.

She
was
taken
postoperatively
to
the
recovery
room
already
making
a
large
amount
of
urine
.

Intraoperatively
,
for
immunosuppression
she
received
thymoglobulin
and
Solu-Medrol
.

She
was
started
on
Prograf
and
CellCept
in
the
postoperative
period
.

She
was
also
maintained
on
Bactrim
postoperatively
and
did
not
require
ganciclovir
,
as
she
and
her
sister
were
cytomegalovirus
negative
.

The
patient
's
initial
postoperative
course
was
relatively
uneventful
.

Her
creatinine
,
which
was
5
initially
postoperatively
,
slowly
dropped
over
the
next
few
days
until
eventually
reaching
a
low
of
1
.

She
did
receive
pamidronate
on
postoperative
day
one
and
received
a
total
of
four
doses
thymoglobulin
.

Her
steroid
doses
were
slowly
tapered
over
her
hospital
course
,
and
her
Prograf
level
was
adjusted
to
maintain
therapeutic
values
between
10
and
15
.

She
continued
to
make
good
urine
over
the
first
few
days
and
had
her
urine
losses
replaced
with
intravenous
fluids
.

On
postoperative
day
three
,
the
patient
had
an
episode
of
shortness
of
breath
that
was
evaluated
by
both
the
Renal
and
surgical
residents
.

It
was
found
that
she
was
in
acute
pulmonary
edema
and
required
transfer
to
the
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

Her
blood
pressure
at
the
time
of
this
incident
was
in
the
range
of
200/120
.

Her
electrocardiogram
showed
no
specific
ST
changes
,
but
there
was
some
loss
of
her
R
wave
progression
laterally
.

Serial
enzymes
were
drawn
,
and
Cardiology
was
consulted
.

With
blood
pressure
control
via
a
nitroglycerin
drip
and
fluid
restriction
,
the
patient
quickly
improved
and
a
had
a
relatively
short
stay
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

Throughout
this
time
,
her
creatinine
continued
to
drop
,
and
there
was
no
apparent
deleterious
effect
on
her
transplant
from
this
episode
.

Her
beta
blocker
was
progressively
increased
,
and
her
nitroglycerin
drip
was
weaned
down
.

Two
days
after
this
event
,
she
underwent
an
echocardiogram
which
was
significant
for
slightly
depressed
left
ventricular
systolic
function
with
severe
posterior
wall
hypokinesis
.

This
was
a
change
from
her
prior
echocardiogram
and
demonstrated
evidence
of
a
small
myocardial
infarction
.

Clinically
,
she
did
much
better
and
her
blood

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Saujule
Study
is
a
77-year-old
woman
with
a
history
of
obesity
and
hypertension
who
presents
with
increased
shortness
of
breath
x
5
days
.

Her
shortness
of
breath
has
been
progressive
over
the
last
2-3
years
.

She
has
an
associated
dry
cough
but
no
fevers
,
chills
,
or
leg
pain
.

She
has
dyspnea
on
exertion
.

She
ambulates
with
walker
and
a
cane
secondary
to
osteoarthritis
.

She
becomes
short
of
breath
just
by
getting
up
from
her
chair
and
can
only
walk
2-3
steps
on
a
flat
surface
.

She
feels
light
headed
when
getting
up
.

Her
shortness
of
breath
and
dyspnea
on
exertion
has
been
progressive
for
the
past
several
years
.

It
has
not
been
sudden
or
acute
.

She
sleeps
in
a
chair
up
right
for
the
last
2
1/2
years
secondary
to
osteoarthritis
.

She
has
orthopnea
as
well
but
noparoxysmal
nocturnal
dyspnea
.

She
occasionally
feels
chest
twinges
which
are
nonradiating
but
are
sharp
.

They
last
a
few
seconds
on
the
left
side
and
are
not
associated
with
sweating
,
nausea
,
vomiting
or
syncope
.

She
has
had
lower
extremity
edema
for
thelast
several
years
with
multiple
episodes
of
cellulitis
.

Her
lower
extremity
edema
has
increased
for
the
several
weeks
prior
to
admission
secondary
to
an
inability
to
elevate
her
legs
due
to
a
broken
chair
at
home
.

She
denies
any
pleural
chest
pain
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
acute
and
chronic
shortness
of
breath
.

1.
Cardiovascular
:

The
patient
was
found
to
be
in
congestive
heart
failure
and
thought
likely
secondary
to
diastolic
dysfunction
secondary
to
hypertension
.

The
patient
was
also
found
to
have
pulmonary
hypertension
.

She
ruled
out
for
myocardial
infarction
with
3
negative
enzymes
.

On
admission
,
she
was
diuresed
with
Lasix
and
was
negative
1-2
liters
per
day
for
several
days
.

The
diuresis
was
backed
off
when
her
bicarbonate
increased
from
36
to
39
.

She
was
restarted
on
20
mg
p.o.
q
day
prior
to
discharge
.

Her
lipids
were
checked
with
a
total
cholesterol
of
110
,
triglycerides
59
,
HDL32
,
LDL
64
.

The
patient
had
a
D-dimer
greater
than
1000
with
lower
extremity
non-invasive
studies
which
were
positive
for
a
small
right
common
femoral
clot
.

It
was
unclear
whether
this
was
old
or
new
.

A
TTE
showed
an
ejection
fraction
of
60%
,
mild
mitral
regurgitation
,
left
atrial
enlargement
,
mild
tricuspid
regurgitation
,
pulmonary
artery
pressures
of
44
plus
right
atrial
pressure
.

There
was
an
intra-atrial
shunt
from
the
right
to
the
left
through
a
patent
foramen
ovale
.

Chest
CT
was
a
poor
study
but
did
not
show
a
pulmonary
embolus
.

The
patient
had
subsequent
dobutamine
MIBI
which
was
positive
for
inducible
ischemia
in
the
distribution
of
posterior
descending
coronary
artery
and
posterolateral
coronary
artery
with
a
small
to
medium
perfusion
defect
in
the
inferolateral
wall
and
basal
inferior
wall
which
was
partially
reversible
.

The
cardiology
service
saw
the
patient
and
recommended
medical
management
only
without
catheterization
.

Her
blood
pressure
was
high
so
Captopril
was
titrated
up
to
50
mg
p.o.
t.i.d.
.

She
will
be
discharged
on
Lisinopril
with
further
titration
as
an
outpatient
.

She
is
on
hydrochlorothiazide
50
mg
p.o.
q
day
.

Her
atenolol
was
stopped
due
to
bradycardia
on
admission
but
this
may
be
restarted
as
an
outpatient
in
gentle
doses
with
careful
monitoring
of
heart
rate
.

She
is
on
an
aspirin
.

She
will
be
discharged
on
Lasix
20
mg
for
continued
control
of
her
edema
.

2.
Pulmonary
;

Pulmonary
hypertension
as
seen
on
echocardiogram
.

Unclear
whether
there
are
chronic
pulmonary
embolus
but
did
have
positive
test
for
deep
venous
thrombosis
and
will
be
treated
with
Coumadin
.

An
ABG
was
done
which
showed
pH
7.34
,
pCO2
78
,
pO2
92
on
2
liters
.

Her
bicarbonate
peaked
at
39
and
generally
is
in
the
36-38
range
.

She
has
severe
sleep
apnea
and
falls
asleep
midsentence
.

She
has
episodes
of
not
breathing
.

BIPAP
was
attempted
for
3
nights
in
a
row
and
the
patient
did
not
tolerate
this
.

She
will
need
pulmonary
function
studies
as
an
outpatient
as
these
were
not
done
in
the
hospital
.

The
pulmonary
team
saw
the
patient
and
only
recommended
the
above
testing
.

She
needs
home
oxygen
and
is
currently
at
2
liters
nasal
cannula
oxygen
.

3.
Infectious
disease
:

Evidence
for
cellulitis
on
her
legs
,
likely
due
to
distention
from
edema
and
poor
perfusion
.

She
was
originally
started
on
cefazolin
which
was
then
changed
to
Keflex
with
good
improvement
.

She
will
need
to
continue
for
at
least
10
more
days
or
as
clinically
indicated
by
the
course
of
her
cellulitis
.

4.
Hematology
:

D-dimer
in
the
emergency
room
was
greater
than
1000
and
a
right
common
femoral
clot
was
seen
.

This
clot
was
small
and
it
was
questionable
as
to
whether
it
was
old
or
new
.

She
was
started
on
anticoagulation
given
the
positive
D-dimer
.

Chest
CT
was
nondiagnostic
but
did
not
show
pulmonary
embolus
.

It
was
a
poor
study
.

Heparin
was
maintained
during
her
hospital
course
and
then
Lovenox
was
started
.

Her
dose
was
increased
to
7.5
mg
q
day
the
day
prior
to
discharge
.

She
will
be
discharged
on
this
dose
in
addition
to
1
day
of
Lovenox
.

Discharge
INR
1.8
.

Goal
INR
is
2.0-3.0
.

for
TVH
,
sacrospinous
fixation
,
SPARC
,
anterior
and
posterior
repair
with
mesh
,
cystoscopy;
for
pelvic
organ
prolapse
.

There
were
no
intraoperative
complications
and
the

SOCIAL
HISTORY
:

Negative
for
tobacco
,
negative
for
alcohol
.

The
patient
lives
alone
,
but
in
a
senior
living
facility
adjacent
to
friends
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1
)
Cardiovascular
:

The
patient
was
admitted
for
rule
out
myocardial
infarction
.

She
remained
on
telemetry
for
greater
than
48
hours
which
demonstrated
no
dysrhythmia
during
this
time
.

The
patient
underwent
an
echocardiogram
which
demonstrated
a
preserved
ejection
fraction
with
left
ventricular
hypertrophy
and
no
significant
valvular
abnormalities
.

The
patient
was
maintained
on
her
aspirin
and
Lasix
.

The
patient
&apos;s
Diltiazem
was
stopped
due
to
her
increased
blood
pressure
and
was
started
on
Labetalol
which
was
gradually
titrated
up
to
a
target
blood
pressure
of
160-170
systolic
in
her
right
arm
.

The
patient
also
underwent
an
Adenosine
MIBI
stress
test
which
showed
only
mild
lateral
ischemia
.

At
this
time
,
the
patient
&apos;s
presyncopal
symptoms
were
not
felt
to
be
secondary
to
a
cardiovascular
etiology
.

2
)
Neurological
/
vascular
:

The
discrepancy
in
the
patient
&apos;s
pulses
and
blood
pressure
was
felt
to
be
consistent
with
a
subclavian
artery
stenosis
.

The
patient
underwent
MRI
/
MRA
of
the
head
,
neck
and
upper
chest
which
demonstrated
a
proximal
left
subclavian
artery
stenosis
,
proximal
to
the
take
off
of
the
left
vertebral
artery
.

The
left
vertebral
artery
had
a
decreased
flow
consistent
with
either
native
vessel
disease
or
some
degree
of
retrograde
flow
with
subclavian
steal
phenomenon
.

The
patient
had
patent
carotids
bilaterally
on
her
neck
MRA
.

MRI
of
the
head
demonstrated
a
small
vessel
disease
and
was
likely
an
old
right
cerebellar
infarct
.

The
patient
underwent
non-invasive
carotid
ultrasounds
which
demonstrated
no
significant
carotid
disease
.

The
patient
was
also
noted
to
have
antegrade
flow
in
both
of
her
vertebral
arteries
bilaterally
.

The
results
of
these
studies
suggested
that
the
patient
&apos;s
symptoms
were
not
due
to
subclavian
steal
phenomenon
,
and
therefore
,
it
was
decided
that
the
patient
would
not
go
further
to
angio
and
/
or
surgical
or
percutaneous
intervention
.

A
Neurology
consult
was
obtained
and
it
was
felt
that
the
most
valuable
intervention
that
could
be
done
for
the
patient
&apos;s
intervascular
disease
would
be
adequate
control
of
her
blood
pressure
.

3
)
Orthopedic
:

The
patient
suffered
a
fall
at
home
with
her
initial
event
.

Outside
hip
films
were
obtained
,
but
were
not
available
for
view
.

Repeat
hip
films
demonstrated
a
right
sided
pubic
rami
fracture
,
likely
new
.

An
Orthopedics
consult
was
obtained
and
the
patient
was
encouraged
to
weight
bear
as
tolerated
with
Physical
Therapy
assistance
.

A
bone
scan
was
also
obtained
to
rule
out
an
occult
hip
fracture
which
was
negative
.

At
the
time
of
this
dictation
,
the
patient
was
able
to
bear
weight
with
the
assistance
of
Physical
Therapy
and
a
walker
.

Plans
were
made
for
the
patient
to
be
discharged
to
Dwardmegriff
Rehabilitation
for
rehabilitation
of
her
rami
fracture
.

4
)
Gastrointestinal
:

The
patient
had
an
episode
of
her
described
vertigo
while
lying
in
bed
and
on
the
monitor
during
which
no
dysrhythmia
was
noted
.

The
patient
also
complained
of
frequent
vomiting
at
least
once
a
day
,
occasionally
associated
with
ingestion
of
her
medications
,
but
sometimes
associated
with
ambulation
.

The
patient
has
a
long-standing
history
of
spontaneous
emesis
due
to
overwhelming
stress
or
excitement
.

However
,
the
patient
reports
emesis
in
the
hospital
more
frequently
.

The
patient
&apos;s
emesis
was
noted
to
be
bilious
without
evidence
of
new
or
old
blood
.

The
etiology
of
the
patient
&apos;s
nausea
remained
unclear
as
she
demonstrated
ability
to
keep
down
many
of
her
meals
which
did
not
suggest
an
anatomical
lesion
of
her
gastrointestinal
tract
.

The
patient
was
started
on
Meclizine
on
December
31
,
2000
for
her
nausea
and
vertigo
.

An
attempt
was
also
made
to
reduce
the
patient
&apos;s
large
number
of
medications
and
the
patient
&apos;s
Os-Cal
,
multivitamin
,
Lasix
and
Colace
were
discontinued
.

5
)
Infectious
disease
:

The
patient
complained
of
some
urinary
incontinence
and
difficulty
initiating
urine
on
December
30
,
2000
.

Urinalysis
demonstrated
a
likely
urinary
tract
infection
.

The
patient
was
started
on
Levofloxacin
250
mg
p.o.
q.
day
times
seven
days
for
a
possible
nosocomial
urinary
tract
infection
.

The
urine
culture
was
pending
at
the
time
of
this
dictation
.

6
)
Fluids
,
electrolytes
and
nutrition
:

The
patient
had
a
mild
increase
in
her
BUN
and
creatinine
during
her
hospitalization
which
promptly
returned
to
her
baseline
levels
with
intravenous
fluids
.

The
patient
was
encouraged
to
increase
her
p.o.
intake
.

Patient
&apos;s
problem
started
four

in
pain

HISTORY
AND
REASON
FOR
HOSPITALIZATION
:

The
patient
is
a
79
year
old
gentleman
with
a
history
of
an
ascending
aortic
graft
replacement
in
1991
for
aortic
dissection
.

At
that
time
the
patient
's
hospital
course
was
complicated
by
a
sternal
wound
infection
requiring
a
sternal
debridement
and
subsequent
abdominal
flap
.

The
patient
was
then
continued
by
report
on
Dicloxacillin
for
approximately
one
year
following
that
reconstructive
operation
.

The
patient
apparently
did
well
until
June
1998
when
he
noted
a
bulge
in
his
sternal
area
.

A
ruptured
aneurysm
or
pseudoaneurysm
at
the
junction
of
the
graft
and
arch
was
diagnosed
and
this
was
subsequently
repaired
.

The
patient
then
had
recurrent
bleeding
two
weeks
later
which
was
once
again
repaired
.

However
the
same
problem
recurred
for
a
third
time
and
a
computer
tomogram
scan
at
an
outside
hospital
showed
an
anterior
hematoma
.

By
report
the
patient
was
at
that
time
told
that
there
was
no
more
that
could
be
done
for
him
and
was
then
apparently
placed
on
comfort
measures
and
pain
control
at
the
outside
hospital
.

However
the
patient
was
then
subsequently
transferred
to
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
upon
request
of
the
family
on
8/24/98
for
further
evaluation
and
possible
intervention
.

The
patient
was
evaluated
by
Dr.
Rhalt
of
Dentvailr.
Medical
Center
.

As
the
patient
's
early
evaluation
the
patient
underwent
an
aortogram
which
showed
an
ascending
aortic
graft
with
bulging
flaps
and
a
pseudoaneurysm
at
the
anastomosis
of
the
graft
and
arch
just
below
the
great
vessels
.

There
was
no
evidence
for
a
definite
leak
but
there
was
evidence
for
gas
bubbles
in
the
anterior
posterior
distal
ends
of
the
grafts
consistent
with
an
infectious
process
.

At
the
same
time
the
patient
was
seen
in
consultation
by
the
Infectious
Disease
Service
who
upon
culturing
the
patient
's
sternal
drainage
switched
the
patient
from
intravenous
Unasyn
to
Levofloxacin
for
what
appeared
to
be
Citrobacter
and
Diphtheroids
in
the
wound
cultures
.

Subsequent
to
starting
this
antibiotic
regimen
the
patient
's
wound
drainage
appeared
to
subside
.

Given
all
the
findings
on
the
aortogram
and
the
subsequent
chest
computer
tomogram
scan
it
was
discovered
that
the
patient
's
only
real
surgical
option
for
cure
was
a
risky
operation
that
involved
removal
and
replacement
of
the
aortic
graft
probably
with
homograft
and
long
term
antibiotic
coverage
as
well
as
a
plastic
surgical
reconstructive
procedure
.

The
patient
understood
the
risks
and
potential
benefits
of
the
procedure
and
was
willing
to
proceed
.

The
patient
otherwise
complained
of
no
angina
,
no
shortness
of
breath
,
no
paroxysmal
nocturnal
dyspnea
,
no
edema
,
no
palpitations
or
symptoms
of
syncope
.

He
did
report
a
20
lbs
weight
loss
over
the
last
several
months
.

exposed
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
initially
admitted
to
the
Cardiac
Surgical
Service
under
Dr.
Rhalt
.

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Cardiac
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
given
the
patient
's
precarious
condition
.

Over
the
next
several
hospital
days
the
patient
underwent
aortogram
as
well
as
chest
computer
tomogram
as
outlined
earlier
.

The
patient
was
also
seen
in
consultation
by
the
Infectious
Disease
Service
as
well
as
the
Cardiology
Service
who
assisted
in
managing
the
patient
's
intermittent
hypertension
.

The
patient
was
also
seen
preoperatively
in
consultation
by
the
Plastic
Surgical
Service
for
potential
sternal
reconstruction
.

After
lengthy
discussions
with
the
patient
and
the
patient
's
family
as
well
as
the
various
consultant
services
it
was
decided
that
the
patient
was
a
viable
candidate
for
aortic
root
replacement
procedure
using
homograft
.

This
was
obtained
on
08/30/98
by
Dr.
Niste
Rhalt
of
the
Cardiac
Surgical
Service
.

The
patient
was
then
subsequently
taken
to
the
Operating
Room
on
08/31/98
with
the
preoperative
diagnosis
of
ascending
aortic
graft
infection
.

The
procedure
performed
was
homograft
replacement
of
the
ascending
aorta
with
omentopexy
and
an
open
chest
.

The
aortic
perfusions
were
via
the
femoral
artery
with
venous
return
by
the
femoral
vein
.

The
cardiopulmonary
bypass
time
was
one
hour
and
49
minutes
.

The
graft
used
was
a
homograft
.

The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
fairly
well
and
was
transferred
intubated
to
the
Cardiac
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
with
his
chest
open
.

The
immediate
postoperative
plans
were
for
a
short
Intensive
Care
Unit
stay
and
subsequent
plastic
surgical
reconstruction
of
the
patient
's
sternum
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
Cardiac
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
in
stable
condition
.

There
he
continued
to
be
hemodynamically
stable
.

Of
note
,
intraoperatively
multiple
tissue
cultures
had
been
sent
.

In
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
the
patient
was
kept
intubated
and
sedated
until
09/02/98
which
was
postoperative
day
no.
1
following
the
homograft
replacement
.

On
that
day
the
Plastic
Surgical
Service
performed
further
sternal
debridement
and
subsequent
reconstruction
using
bilateral
pectoralis
major
myocutaneous
advancement
flaps
and
right
superiorly
rectus
abdominis
flap
to
cover
the
patient
's
sternal
wound
with
subsequent
primary
closure
of
that
wound
.

The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
well
and
there
were
no
complications
.

A
number
of
indwelling
closed
suction
drains
were
left
in
place
so
as
to
drain
the
bed
underneath
the
muscle
flaps
.

The
patient
was
then
transferred
back
to
the
Cardiac
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
in
stable
condition
.

At
this
point
the
patient
continued
to
followed
by
Infectious
Disease
Service
and
continued
to
be
on
intravenous
antibiotics
which
included
Vancomycin
and
Levofloxacin
.

The
Operating
Room
cultures
at
that
point
were
positive
for
Crinobactermium
with
sputum
cultures
being
sensitive
for
yeast
and
gram
positive
cocci
in
clusters
.

Over
the
next
postoperative
day
the
patient
was
awakened
and
weaned
to
extubate
without
significant
difficulties
.

The
patient
's
subsequent
postoperative
course
was
characterized
by
persistent
hypertension
which
required
a
significant
amount
of
antihypertensives
including
Lopressor
100
mg
po
three
times
a
day
,
Captopril
100
mg
po
three
times
a
day
,
as
well
as
Procardia
.

The
patient
otherwise
continued
to
do
well
and
was
becoming
more
oriented
as
time
went
on
and
as
his
blood
pressure
was
brought
under
control
.

Subsequently
on
postoperative
day
no.
8
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
the
patient
was
felt
to
be
ready
for
transfer
to
the
Cardiac
Surgical
Inpatient
Service
.

The
patient
continued
to
be
followed
by
the
Infectious
Disease
Service
who
felt
that
the
patient
's
Jackson
Pratt
drains
needed
to
stay
in
as
there
was
still
some
significant
drainage
from
them
.

As
per
the
Infectious
Disease
Service
the
patient
was
continued
on
Levofloxacin
,
Vancomycin
as
antibiotic
coverage
.

However
on
09/08/98
the
Infectious
Disease
Service
was
made
aware
that
the
patient
's
intraoperative
cultures
had
also
grown
out
Mycoplasma
humilius
.

Given
this
finding
it
was
felt
that
the
patient
would
certainly
need
long
term
intravenous
antibiotics
to
include
at
least
six
weeks
of
Vancomycin
and
then
subsequent
Levofloxacin
for
the
Citrobacter
and
Mycoplasma
as
well
.

The
patient
was
scheduled
for
peripherally
inserted
central
catheter
line
placement
knowing
that
he
was
going
to
need
long
term
intravenous
antibiotics
.

This
was
placed
on
postoperative
day
no.
9
without
any
difficulty
.

At
the
same
time
the
patient
continued
to
be
stable
on
his
antihypertensive
regimen
.

He
was
becoming
more
mobile
and
was
taking
a
high
protein
high
calories
diet
which
he
tolerated
well
.

He
continued
to
be
afebrile
and
otherwise
very
stable
.

On
postoperative
day
no.
12
the
patient
was
noted
to
have
fallen
and
subsequently
dislocating
the
PIP
joint
of
his
left
middle
finger
.

Subsequent
hand
x-rays
obtained
showed
no
evidence
of
fracture
but
the
patient
was
seen
in
consultation
by
the
Plastic
Surgery
Hand
Service
.

The
patient
will
benefit
from
splinting
of
his
finger
while
the
swelling
subsided
and
subsequent
early
mobilization
to
prevent
any
rigidity
in
that
joint
.

The
patient
was
also
seen
subsequently
in
consultation
by
the
Plastic
Surgical
Service
who
discontinued
a
number
of
the
patient
's
indwelling
drains
but
they
felt
that
others
needed
to
stay
while
the
patient
was
sent
to
rehabilitation
.

These
drains
will
then
be
subsequently
taken
out
by
Dr.
General
upon
his
followup
with
the
patient
.

Prior
to
discharge
the
patient
also
underwent
an
audiogram
as
a
baseline
hearing
test
while
the
patient
was
to
stay
on
long
term
intravenous
antibiotics
.

The
patient
otherwise
continued
to
be
hemodynamically
stable
making
good
progress
.

As
a
matter
of
fact
the
patient
made
remarkable
progress
given
the
severity
of
his
disease
condition
prior
to
the
operation
.

The
patient
's
condition
continued
to
be
improved
.

Given
this
finding
the
patient
was
therefore
felt
to
be
ready
for
discharge
to
a
rehabilitation
facility
on
09/13/1998
.

In
consultation
with
the
Infectious
Disease
Service
the
patient
was
to
stay
on
long
term
intravenous
antibiotics
.

FINDINGS
:

The
sagittal
T1
images
demonstrate
several
areas
of
high
signal
along
the
sulci
bilaterally
which
could
be
secondary
to
subarachnoid
hemorrhages
.

There
are
several
areas
of
hyperintensities
at
the
convexity
which
could
be
intraaxial
and
could
be
related
to
hemorrhage
within
the
metastatic
lesions
but
in
absence
of
gradient
echo
images
,
this
could
not
be
further
confirmed
.

A
CT
would
help
for
further
assessment
if
indicated
.

There
is
increased
signal
seen
in
both
basal
ganglia
region
as
well
as
along
the
rolandic
region
bilaterally
which
is
suggestive
of
global
hypoxic
injury
to
the
brain
.

There
are
several
areas
of
brain
edema
identified
in
the
left
frontal
and
parietal
lobe
and
both
temporal
lobes
,
which
are
suspicious
for
areas
of
metastatic
disease
with
surrounding
edema
.

There
is
no
hydrocephalus
or
midline
shift
seen
.

No
herniation
is
identified
.

Images
through
the
skull
base
demonstrate
soft
tissue
changes
in
the
sphenoid
sinus
which
could
be
due
to
retained
secretions
from
intubation
.

There
is
increased
signal
seen
along
the
sulci
on
FLAIR
images
at
the
convexity
which
could
be
secondary
to
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
.

A
CT
would
help
for
further
assessment
and
exclude
proteinaceous
material
within
the
sulci
.

Gadolinium-enhanced
MRI
would
also
help
for
further
assessment
.

Neurologic
-
The
patient
was
seen
by
the
Neurology
consult
service
and
underwent
MRI
head
which
revealed
lesions
suspicious
for
metastases
,
possible
hemorrhages
,
and
findings
consistent
with
hypoxic
brain
injury
.

EEG
was
performed
and
revealed
encephalopathy
.

The
patient
's
neurologic
exam
(
performed
after
sedation
removed
>48
hours
)
revealed
intact
brainstem
function
without
evidence
of
higher
cortical
activity
.

She
had
some
metabolic
abnormalities
which
were
corrected
(
hypernatremia
,
hyperphosphatemia
)
,
but
neurologic
exam
was
unchanged
.

A
family
meeting
on
2016-05-13
was
held
and
these
findings
communicated
with
the
patient
's
family
.

Final
neurologic
assessment
was
that
the
patient
was
unlikely
to
regain
meaningful
neurologic
functioning
.

At
the
request
of
her
family
,
she
will
be
transferred
closer
to
her
home
in
Wyoming
,
to

The

Dr.
Pauling

Upon
discussion

him
it

had
progression

disease
after
systemic
therapy
with
topotecan

She
then
proceed

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
Team
Four
for
cardiac
monitoring
and
ruling
out
for
MI
.

Hospital
course
by
system
:

1.
Cardiovascular
:

The
patient
ruled
out
for
MI
by
cardiac
markers
.

The
patient
was
set
to
go
for
a
dobutamine
stress
test
on
11/16/04
given
her
history
of
COPD
,
but
the
stress
portion
was
canceled
when
she
was
down
there
due
to
fever
and
hypotension
.

The
next
day
,
she
underwent
a
cardiac
echo
(
transthoracic
echocardiogram
)
.

This
echo
showed
LV
ejection
fraction
of
50%
with
no
wall
motion
abnormality
.

However
,
the
right
ventricular
was
diffusely
hypokinetic
.

It
was
suboptimally
imaged
,
so
there
was
no
RVSP
given
.

The
patient
also
suffered
a
hypotensive
episode
while
in
the
endoscopy
suite
for
her
EGD
on
11/17/04
.

This
responded
to
fluid
bolus
.

The
patient
was
then
transferred
to
Medicine
Team
D
given
her
tenuous
hemodynamic
status
.

The
patient
,
several
days
later
11/23
,
underwent
another
dobutamine
stress
test
.

This
stress
test
,
although
complicated
by
hypotension
again
,
to
the
60
&apos;s
or
70
&apos;s
was
completed
and
there
was
some
mild
anterior
septal
thinning
,
but
no
evidence
of
ischemia
and
an
EF
from
this
test
was
76%
.

Clearly
,
the
patient
&apos;s
hemodynamic
vascular
status
was
very
sensitive
to
dobutamine
.

2.
Infectious
Disease
:

On
hospital
day
#2
,
the
patient
was
noted
to
have
increased
dyspnea
on
exertion
.

The
next
day
she
developed
a
fever
and
she
was
started
on
levofloxacin
for
a
potential
UTI
.

She
continued
to
have
low-grade
fevers
and
on
the
next
day
,
11/17/04
,
her
chest
x-ray
showed
possible
new
right
upper
lobe
infiltrates
.

She
was
then
started
on
ceftriaxone
and
azithromycin
.

Her
urine
legionella
antigen
was
negative
.

On
11/22/04
,
she
was
noted
to
have
gram-positive
cocci
in
her
sputum
.

She
was
started
on
vancomycin
for
this
.

These
bacteria
turned
out
to
be
MRSA
and
she
was
continued
on
her
vancomycin
.

She
had
PICC
line
placed
on
the
day
prior
to
discharge
for
home
vancomycin
administration
.

3.
GI
:

The
patient
had
an
episode
of
nausea
on
the
morning
of
11/16/04
associated
with
some
cough
,
apparent
emesis
.

GI
was
consulted
for
an
EGD
,
however
,
while
she
was
in
the
Endoscopy
Suite
,
as
mentioned
above
,
she
had
a
hypotensive
episode
,
which
responded
to
some
fluid
boluses
.

Finally
,
on
the
day
prior
to
discharge
,
she
was
stabilized
to
the
point
that
she
could
have
her
EGD
.

The
EGD
did
show
three
esophageal
ulcers
that
were
localized
and
apparent
suggestion
of
pill
esophagitis
.

Her
stomach
and
duodenum
were
normal
and
it
was
suggested
that
she
change
her
Nexium
doses
to
daily
and
that
she
also
drink
plenty
of
fluids
and
water
with
meals
,
sit
upright
when
she
would
eat
her
meals
to
decrease
the
chance
of
pills
eroding
her
esophagus
.

4.
Shortness
of
breath
:

As
mentioned
above
,
the
patient
did
develop
MRSA
pneumonia
that
was
started
to
be
treated
with
vancomycin
and
she
did
also
develop
an
oxygen
requirement
the
day
prior
to
discharge
.

At
most
,
her
oxygen
requirement
was
4-5
liters
and
on
the
day
prior
to
discharge
,
she
was
satting
well
on
two
liters
of
nasal
cannula
.

This
was
thought
to
be
due
to
her
pneumonia
;
however
,
with
her
right
ventricular
hypokinesis
,
it
is
also
possible
that
she
may
have
an
element
of
pulmonary
hypertension
and
may
warrant
further
investigation
as
an
outpatient
,
for
example
,
with
chest
CT
.

5.
Derm
:

Several
days
prior
to
discharge
,
the
patient
developed
some
erythematous
rash
under
her
left
breast
and
left
side
that
was
thought
to
be
due
to
yeast
.

She
was
started
on
some
Miconazole
Cream
.

The
rash
was
always
localized
to
her
left
side
,
sometimes
extending
down
to
her
leg
,
but
never
on
the
right
side
.

The
rash
appeared
to
be
resolving
by
the
time
of
discharge
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
is
a
71-year-old-female
with
asthma
and
a
history
of
recent
exacerbation
of
lower
extremity
edema
who
,
at
her
baseline
,
gets
short
of
breath
walking
across
the
room
and
sleeps
on
four
pillows
times
several
years
.

She
has
reported
that
she
has
had
upper
respiratory
symptoms
times
several
days
with
increasing
dyspnea
on
exertion
and
shortness
of
breath
,
eventually
at
rest
with
marked
wheezing
.

She
also
has
a
cough
with
a
small
amount
of
white
sputum
.

At
3
a.m.
on
the
day
of
admission
,
she
became
much
worse
and
after
several
days
of
increasing
her
meter-dosed
inhaler
use
,
she
call
Emergency
Medical
Services
which
assessed
her
as
having
heart
failure
with
elevated
jugular
venous
distention
and
rales
.

She
received
aspirin
,
Lasix
40
mg
intravenously
times
two
,
0.8
mg
of
nitroglycerin
times
four
,
plus
morphine
sulfate
.

Her
blood
pressure
was
noted
to
be
up
to
220/110
.

She
was
taken
to
the
The
Hospital
for
Orthopedics
Emergency
Room
where
she
was
assessed
as
having
asthma
.

She
then
received
continuous
nebulizer
treatments
for
approximately
eight
hours
with
minimal
improvement
.

She
did
receive
intravenous
nitroglycerin
in
the
Emergency
Room
for
blood
pressure
controlled
to
the
170s
.

She
initially
received
a
treatment
of
BiPAP
on
arrival
as
she
was
barely
able
to
speak
.

She
also
received
80
mg
of
Solu-Medrol
in
the
Emergency
Department
.

She
was
never
hypoxic
but
initially
her
arterial
blood
gas
showed
a
respiratory
acidosis
with
a
PCO2
of
71
.

The
patient
does
have
a
vague
history
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
,
but
this
is
felt
to
be
inaccurate
.

She
also
received
captopril
12.5
mg
times
one
.

Recently
,
the
patient
has
been
treated
with
several
steroid
tapers
.

Depending
on
the
family
,
patient
,
and
the
OMR
records
,
the
exact
duration
of
the
most
recent
one
was
unclear
.

It
either
ended
in
2011-04-11
or
continued
through
2011-05-11
with
use
of
Augmentin
;
and
,
by
report
,
lasted
until
06-07
.

However
,
the
family
said
the
patient
has
been
on
steroids
for
several
weeks
.

The
patient
denies
any
exposure
to
smoke
,
animals
,
unusual
dust
or
vapors
,
or
other
asthma
triggers
.

but
no
evidence
of
congestive

.

Electrocardiogram
showed
sinus
tachycardia
at

The
patient
had
a
stress
echocardiogram
with
a
normal
ejection
fraction
in
2007
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
BY
SYSTEM:

1.
PULMONARY
:

She
was
treated
with
albuterol
and
Atrovent
continuous
nebulizers
and
was
weaned
then
to
intermittent
nebulizer
treatments
and
then
to
her
meter-dosed
inhalers
taking
them
q.4h.
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

She
was
continued
on
salmeterol
and
Flovent
.

She
was
continued
on
Solu-Medrol
80
mg
q.8h.
then
converted
to
prednisone
at
60
mg
p.o.
q.d.

She
was
started
on
Singulair
10
mg
p.o.
q.d.

Serial
arterial
blood
gases
were
followed
after
an
arterial
line
was
placed
.

Her
PCO2
gradually
declined
to
the
48
range
.

Despite
episodes
of
somnolence
the
first
night
which
were
presumably
due
to
having
spent
the
entire
night
in
the
Emergency
Department
,
she
never
became
more
hypercarbic
,
and
her
PCO2
trended
to
48
by
the
time
the
arterial
line
was
discontinued
.

On
the
night
of
admission
and
thereafter
,
she
was
noted
to
have
a
very
stridorous
sounding
breathing
when
the
patient
was
asleep
.

This
would
disappear
whenever
she
was
awake
.

Her
case
was
discussed
with
Ear/Nose/Throat
and
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
attending
.

She
was
given
a
trial
of
80/20
mixed
helium/oxygen
to
decrease
the
stridor
but
had
minimal
effect
.

Ear/Nose/Throat
recommended
not
considering
this
an
airway
problem
unless
she
was
stridorous
while
awake
.

The
patient
was
to
arrange
for
Pulmonary
and
Medicine
followup
through
her
primary
care
physician
upon
discharge
as
she
has
not
been
seen
in
the
Pulmonary
Clinic
in
two
years
.

2.
CARDIOVASCULAR
:

The
patient
ruled
out
for
myocardial
infarction
with
serial
creatine
kinases
,
although
these
did
rise
to
816
.

MB
was
negative
.

She
was
treated
with
captopril
for
hypertension
,
and
this
was
switched
to
Norvasc
7.5
mg
p.o.
q.d.
on
discharge
.

She
had
an
echocardiogram
which
showed
a
hyperdynamic
left
ventricular
of
normal
thickness
and
size
,
and
no
significant
valvular
disease
.

She
apparently
did
not
have
a
cardiovascular
component
to
her
wheezing
or
shortness
of
breath
;
however
,
she
was
to
go
home
on
Lasix
20
mg
p.o.
q.d.
to
help
with
lower
extremity
edema
,
as
she
experiences
discomfort
with
this
,
and
the
team
felt
this
may
be
a
limiting
factor
with
her
prednisone
compliance
.

3.
ENDOCRINE
:

She
was
treated
with
a
sliding-scale
of
regular
insulin
while
she
was
in
house
.

She
was
given
500
mg
p.o.
q.d.
of
metformin
to
treat
her
steroid-induced
diabetes
on
discharge
.

This
should
be
followed
up
by
her
primary
care
physician
.

4.
INFECTIOUS
DISEASE
:

She
was
treated
briefly
with
levofloxacin
because
of
the
gram-positive
cocci
in
her
sputum
culture
;
however
,
her
symptoms
were
felt
to
be
consistent
with
a
viral
upper
respiratory
infection
,
and
levofloxacin
was
continued
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE:

1.
Chest
pain
:

The
patient
ruled
out
for
myocardial
infarction
.

However
,
with
her
history
of
disease
,
patient
underwent
a
cardiac
catheterization
.

The
patient
was
found
at
cardiac
catheterization
to
have
mild
diffuse
instent
restenosis
in
the
mid
stent
,
otherwise
hemodynamically
normal
and
the
coronary
arteries
otherwise
were
without
flow-limiting
stenoses
.

The
patient
was
then
continued
on
her
cardiac
medications
.

It
was
felt
that
if
we
attempted
aspirin
desensitize
her
while
an
inpatient
,
then
she
would
benefit
from
the
use
of
aspirin
and
Plavix
.

The
patient
was
sent
to
the
CCU
and
underwent
aspirin
desensitization
protocol
,
which
she
tolerated
well
.

She
had
mild
worsening
of
her
asthma
attacks
,
which
was
relieved
by
Benadryl
and
occasionally
albuterol
.

The
patient
found
that
if
she
took
the
aspirin
in
the
evening
with
her
Benadryl
that
she
takes
for
sleep
,
that
the
asthma
exacerbation
did
not
occur
.

Aspirin
no
longer
should
be
considered
an
allergy
for
this
patient
,
and
she
is
going
to
take
this
as
an
outpatient
.

2.
Hyperlipidemia
:

The
patient
's
Lipitor
was
increased
to
80
mg
q.d.

3.
Back
pain
:

This
is
a
chronic
issue
and
was
controlled
with
Flexeril
and
Vicodin
.

:

To
home
.

DISCHARGE
STATUS
:

Patient
is
able

revealed
a
large
right
occipital
infarct
without

shift
,
but
positive
mass
effect
on
the
temporal
horn
,
on
the
right
ventricle
and
some
effacement
of
the
sulci
in
the
right
parietal
area
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
a
telemetry
bed
and
started
on
heparin
.

Around
4:00
AM
the
next
day
,
an
acute
decompensation
in
respiratory
status
was
noted
.

Lung
examination
at
that
point
showed
good
air
entry
,
no
wheezing
,
coarse
breath
sounds
throughout
.

Neurologically
,
the
patient
was
not
following
commands
.

Eyes
were
closed
.

He
was
moving
the
right
arm
and
leg
spontaneously
,
though
less
than
before
.

Withdrawal
to
pain
was
still
present
.

Both
plantars
were
upgoing
.

A
blood
gas
at
this
point
showed
a
pH
of
7.49
,
pO2
61
,
pCO2
of
33
on
100%
non-rebreather
mask
.

EKG
showed
sinus
tachycardia
.

The
patient
&apos;s
temperature
was
102
degrees
.

A
repeat
CAT
scan
of
the
head
was
performed
.

This
showed
continued
evolution
of
the
right
posterior
cerebral
artery
infarction
now
extending
into
the
right
cerebellar
hemisphere
.

There
was
also
a
high
density
adjacent
to
the
right
cerebellar
infarction
suggesting
the
presence
of
hemorrhage
.

At
this
point
,
the
patient
was
transferred
to
the
intensive
care
unit
.

An
MRI
and
MRA
of
the
head
was
arranged
to
evaluate
the
extent
of
his
stroke
and
the
posterior
circulation
.

The
MRI
showed
infarct
of
the
cerebellar
hemispheres
bilaterally
,
the
right
occipital
lobe
,
the
right
thalamus
and
bilateral
pons
.

The
MRA
of
the
intracranial
circulation
demonstrated
gross
patency
of
the
internal
carotid
arteries
bilaterally
and
the
basilar
arteries
.

The
left
vertebral
artery
was
not
visualized
.

There
was
a
dominant
right
vertebral
artery
.

There
was
mildly
reduced
flow
in
the
branches
of
the
right
middle
cerebral
artery
compared
to
the
left
.

There
was
visualization
of
flow
within
both
posterior
cerebral
arteries
.

Clinically
,
the
patient
continued
to
deteriorate
.

Neurosurgery
was
consulted
,
however
the
neurosurgeons
felt
that
there
was
no
surgical
option
,
since
even
in
the
case
of
cerebellar
swelling
,
there
would
be
no
improvement
from
decompensation
.

The
patient
was
therefore
treated
conservatively
with
fluid
restriction
and
blood
pressure
management
.

Heparin
was
discontinued
because
of
the
risk
of
intercerebral
hemorrhage
.

The
aspiration
pneumonia
was
treated
with
Cefotaxime
and
Metronidazole
.

The
patient
&apos;s
family
was
involved
and
they
decided
to
opt
for
DNR
/
DNI
in
view
of
the
poor
prognosis
.

The
patient
passed
away
at
6:45
AM
on
June
12
,
1998
.

ABDOMINAL
AORTIC
ANEURYSM
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Patient
is
a
64
year
old
white
male
with
a
past
medical
history
of
smoking
,
coronary
artery
disese
,
hypertension
,
and
hypercholesterolemia
with
a
l0
cm
abdominal
aortic
aneurysm
.

Patient
presented
to
his
private
medical
doctor
in
Gewestster
with
transient
calf
pain
on
walking
less
than
fifty
yards
.

Abdominal
aortic
aneurysm
was
discovered
on
examination
and
patient
was
referred
to
Retelk
County
Medical
Center
.

He
was
admitted
on
10/17/06
and
echocardiogram
done
on
11/13/09
revealed
poor
left
ventricular
function
and
cardiac
catheterization
was
done
on
admission
which
showed
three
vessel
disease
.

Patient
was
referred
to
Cardiology
and
underwent
a
three
vessel
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
on
11/25/09
.

His
post-operative
course
was
complicated
by
an
E.
coli
urinary
tract
infection
and
transient
acute
renal
failure
with
increasing
creatinine
.

Patient
&apos;s
renal
function
returned
to
normal
over
several
days
,
however
.

The
patient
&apos;s
last
ultrasound
of
his
aorta
revealed
a
l0
cm
aneurysm
and
he
presented
at
the
time
of
admission
for
an
abdominal
aortic
aneurysm
repair
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
47-year-old
man
with
advanced
stage
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
who
was
admitted
for
autologous
bone
marrow
transplant
as
per
protocol
94-055
of
the
Santusli
Hospital
.

The
patient
was
originally
diagnosed
in
06/98
during
a
routine
physical
when
he
was
noted
to
have
a
white
blood
cell
count
of
20,000
,
weight
loss
,
and
swelling
in
his
neck
and
groin
.

He
was
watched
after
his
initial
diagnosis
,
but
six
months
later
he
developed
rapidly
increasing
leukocytosis
and
he
became
more
symptomatic
.

After
treatment
with
three
cycles
of
fludarabine
he
had
90%
involvement
of
his
intratrabecular
space
.

He
was
therefore
treated
with
three
cycles
of
fludarabine
in
combination
with
cytoxan
.

After
this
therapy
he
achieved
a
protocol
eligible
minimal
disease
state
.

However
,
he
did
have
relative
pancytopenia
following
this
therapy
.

He
was
taken
to
bone
marrow
harvest
in
08/22
at
which
time
insufficient
cells
were
obtained
to
proceed
.

He
was
returned
previous
to
this
admission
for
repeat
bone
marrow
harvest
and
at
that
time
he
was
given
Neupogen
prior
to
his
harvest
,
and
sufficient
cells
were
not
obtained
to
proceed
with
autologous
bone
marrow
transplantation
.

His
most
recent
bone
marrow
biopsy
revealed
less
than
5%
of
intratrabecular
space
involvement
.

Recent
CT
scan
showed
no
significant
lymphadenopathy
.

The
spleen
was
within
normal
limits
.

##
GNR
sepsis:

Upon
admission
,
pt
was
febrile
to
101.2
with
U/A
consistent
with
UTI
.

A
CT
abd
showed
8mm
obstructing
stone
,
hydro
with
stranding
consistent
with
pylonephritis
.

Her
presentation
was
thought
likely
due
to
urosepsis
given
h/o
foul
smelling
urine
and
in
setting
of
stone
w/
hydro
+
pyelo
by
CT.
The
patient
went
to
IR
on
2014-11-30
given
evidence
of
right
hydronephrosis
on
imaging
for
decompression
and
drainage.
Upon
admission
,
she
was
treated
with
Vancomycin
and
Gentamycin
and
Flagyl
.

She
was
started
on
the
MUST
protocol
with
high
dose
steroids
as
well
and
a
goal
SVO2
>70%
.

She
was
hypoxic
requiring
3L
nasal
cannula
O2
.

She
subsequently
developed
hypotension
with
SBP
in
the
70s
.

She
was
transferred
to
the
CMED
where
the
patient
was
continued
on
the
MUST
protocol
with
goais
of
CVP
10-12
,
SVO2
greater
than
70%
.

The
patient
was
bolused
with
NS
and
did
not
required
pressors
.

On
the
day
after
admission
to
the
CMED
,
the
patient
was
noted
to
have
small
oxygen
requirement
with
2L
NC
.

Repeat
imaging
revealed
evidence
of
mild
pulmonary
congestion
which
was
thought
to
account
for
the
patient
's
mild
hypoxia
.

Given
that
the
patient
had
been
maintaining
a
MAP
of
60
without
fluids
or
pressors
,
her
goal
CVP
was
decreased
to
>8
to
avoid
fluid
overload
.

The
patient
was
continued
on
Vancomycin
and
Gentamycin
while
speciation
and
sensitivities
were
pending
.

Ciprofloxacin
was
added
on
2014-12-01
for
synergy
when
surveillance
cultures
were
found
to
be
growing
again
GNR
.

Gent
and
Cipro
were
then
discontinued
and
changed
to
meropenem
when
blood
culture
sensitivities
became
available
revealing
GNR
sensitive
to
Jacoby
but
resistant
to
both
Gent
and
Cipro
.

Additionaly
surveillance
cultures
were
drawn
daily
and
the
patient
was
transferred
back
to
the
floor
with
no
subsequent
pressor
requirement
.

Blood
cltures
from
11-30
grew
KLEBSIELLA
PNEUMONIAE
and
12-01
grew
KLEBSIELLA
PNEUMONIAE
and
PROTEUS
MIRABILIS
both
sensitive
to
the
Meropenam
which
she
had
already
been
receiving
.

Urine
cultures
from
11-30
grew
STAPH
AUREUS
COAG
+
,
and
GRAM
NEGATIVE
RODS
of
two
morphologies
(

further
speciated
)
.

She
defervesed
by
12-02
and
remained
clinically
stable
with
normal
blood
pressures
until
the
day
of
discharge
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
blood
cultures
from
12-02
and
12-03
have
no
growth
to
date
.

She
received
a
midline
on
12-04
with
a
goal
of
16
days
of
further
antibiotic
treatment
with
Meropenam
(
for
a
total
of
3
weeks
)
upon
discharge
back
to

##
Right
hydronephrosis
:

Given
right
sided
hydronephrosis
and
GNR
bactermeia
,
a
percutaneous
nephrostomy
tube
was
placed
by
IR
2014-11-30
.

The
patient
put
out
1385
cc
urine
the
day
after
placement
,
950
cc
of
which
came
from
nephrostomy
tube
.

The
tube
appeared
to
be
functioning
well
,
draining
urine
with
occasional
clot
passage
.

Urology
was
notified
about
the
clots
and
occasional
blood
tinged
urine
but
they
did
not
make
any
further
recommendations
.

Cultures
from
urine
drawn
from
the
nephrostomy
tube
are
currently
growing

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

This
is
a
72-year-old
male
with
a
history
of
thymoma
resected
in
1996
,
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
,
hypothyroidism
who
was
transferred
from
Gobay
Hos
Memorial
Hospital
for
an
myocardial
infarction
and
cardiac
catheterization
.

The
patient
developed
shortness
of
breath
at
home
and
the
EMTs
were
called
and
the
patient
was
found
to
be
in
respiratory
distress
.

He
was
transferred
to
Gobay
Hos
Memorial
Hospital
where
chest
x-ray
showed
left
lower
lobe
infiltrate
and
cardiac
enzymes
were
elevated
with
a
CK
of
297
,
MB
fraction
of
38
and
troponin
of
12
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
medicine
service
at
the
Retelk
County
Medical
Center
and
underwent
cardiac
catheterization
which
was
negative
for
disease
.

He
continued
to
complain
of
shortness
of
breath
with
an
episode
of
respiratory
failure
in
the
hospital
requiring
100%
nonrebreather
.

Neurology
was
consulted
for
difficulty
lifting
his
arms
.

On
consultation
the
patient
admitted
to
dysphasia
and
periods
of
diplopia
in
the
past
.

The
patient
was
found
to
have
weakness
in
the
proximal
muscles
as
well
as
the
capability
of
the
muscles
.

He
was
started
on
IV
ig
and
IV
Solu-Medrol
for
a
diagnosis
of
myasthenia
gravis
given
his
past
history
of
thymoma
.

He
markedly
improved
after
a
dose
of
Mestinon
.

He
completed
a
five-day
course
of
IV
ig
.

His
work
up
included
acetylcholine
esterase
,
receptor
antibodies
,

ADDENDUM
:

The
patient
was
extubated
overnight
without
incident
.

He
had
a
good
cardiac
index
off
all
inotropic
medications
and
his
Swan-Ganz
catheter
was
discontinued
.

The
patient
underwent
an
exchange
peritoneal
dialysis
.

The
Parrack
Diabetes
Center
was
consulted
to
help
manage
the
patient
's
hyperglycemia
.

By
postoperative
day
two
,
the
patient
had
remained
in
sinus
rhythm
and
his
Lopressor
was
increased
.

He
was
having
a
bit
of
a
respiratory
acidosis
,
therefore
,
bicarbonate
was
added
to
the
dialysate
.

His
mediastinal
chest
tubes
were
removed
,
however
,
his
pleural
chest
tubes
remained
in
place
.

On
postoperative
day
three
,
it
was
apparent
that
,
despite
an
oxygen
saturation
of
99%
on
three
liters
,
that
the
patient
was
still
in
a
respiratory
acidosis
,
and
he
received
aggressive
pulmonary
toilette
.

His
pleural
chest
tubes
were
removed
.

On
postoperative
day
four
,
the
patient
Cordis
was
removed
.

His
Lopressor
was
increased
another
increment
.

The
patient
was
subsequently
transferred
to
the
floor
on
postoperative
day
five
in
stable
and
good
condition
.

Once
on
the
floor
,
the
patient
had
an
uneventful
hospital
course
,
remaining
afebrile
for
the
remainder
of
his
hospital
stay
.

The
patient
's
only
issue
was
his
hypertension
.

On
postoperative
day
seven
,
the
patient
had
a
peak
blood
pressure
of
210/100
.

The
decision
was
made
to
start
the
patient
on
lisinopril
,
and
the
initial
dose
of
7.5
mg
was
increased
to
10
mg
daily
by
the
day
of
discharge
in
order
to
control
his
pressure
more
tightly
.

On
postoperative
day
seven
,
the
patient
was
refusing
to
be
discharged
to
a
rehabilitation
facility
despite
his
doctor
's
insistence
that
he
would
do
much
better
in
an
assisted
environment
.

Nevertheless
,
the
patient
was
adamant
about
going
home
.

The
patient
was
discharged
on
postoperative
day
seven
and
arrangements
were
made
to
have
physical
therapy
perform
a
home
safety
evaluation
for
the
patient
,
to
which
he
agreed
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

In
summary
,
patient
is
a
53
-
year-old
female
with
multiple
medical
problems
and
history
of
depression
with
intentional
overdose
of
barbiturates
,
opiates
,
Tylenol
,
and
beta
blocker
.

CMED
:

Patient
was
maintained
on
insulin
,
D10
and
glucagon
drips
to
maintain
her
hemodynamics
.

This
was
achieved
with
good
effect
,
and
they
were
subsequently
weaned
off
.

Patient
was
able
to
be
extubated
on
hospital
day
three
.

Psychiatry
was
consulted
after
the
patient
was
extubated
,
and
felt
that
patient
had
a
high
suicide
risk
,
and
plan
was
for
her
to
be
admitted
to
the
Psychiatry
service
once
medically
stable
.

Patient
's
renal
function
remained
stable
and
her
CKs
trended
down
gradually
.

Patient
remained
on
suicide
precautions
,
but
was
deemed
not
to
need
ICU
level
monitoring
,
and
was
transferred
to
the
floor
on
01-11
.

In
the
a.m.
of
01/08
,
the
patient
experienced
episode
of
tongue
biting
,
unresponsiveness
,
disorientation
.

Was
loaded
on
Dilantin
.

Became
progressively
hypoxic
and
tachypneic
throughout
the
day
with
respiratory
rates
of
30-40
with
a
max
respiratory
rate
of
116
,
tachycardia
to
120s
.

Patient
subsequently
was
transferred
back
to
the
CMED
CCU
on
2017-01-13
for
further
monitoring
.

Patient
's
hypoxia
was
felt
most
likely
to
be
caused
by
pneumonia
.

She
was
started
on
appropriate
antibiotics
.

Etiology
of
patient
's
tachypnea
was
unclear
.

Initially
,
the
patient
's
etiology
of
seizure
was
not
quite
clear
,
but
thought
possibly
secondary
to
alcohol
and
benzodiazepine
withdrawal
.

She
received
EEG
,
MRI
,
LP
.

Subsequently
EEG
was
noted
to
have
no
seizure
activity
.

MRI
was
suboptimal
due
to
motion
artifact
and
LP
was
unremarkable
.

Despite
absence
of
seizure
activity
on
EEG
,
patient
was
continued
on
Dilantin
.

Her
delirium
was
felt
possibly
secondary
to
withdrawal
versus
toxic
metabolic
,
but
gradually
improved
slowly
,
and
therefore
patient
did
not
receive
treatment
for
barbiturate
withdrawal
.

Her
mental
status
,
tachypnea
,
and
hypoxia
all
improved
,
and
patient
was
subsequently
transferred
back
to
the
floor
medical
team
on
2017-01-15
.

While
on
the
floor
,
the
patient
's
mental
status
was
noted
to
be
improved
back
at
baseline
compared
to
that
back
to
the
CMED
CCU
,
and
she
exhibited
no
evidence
of
barbiturate
withdrawal
.

She
was
continued
on
suicide
precautions
with
a
one-to-one
sitter
,
and
plan
was
for
psychiatric
admission
when
medical
issues
had
resolved
.

On
2017-01-16
,
the
night
float
intern
was
called
to
see
the
patient
as
she
was
unresponsive
.

Patient
unresponsive
to
verbal
command
,
sternal
rub
.

Pupils
were
fixed
and
dilated
.

Patient
noted
to
be
without
corneal
reflexes
,
spontaneous
breathing
,
heart
sounds
,
or
palpable
pulses
.

Patient
was
pronounced
dead
at
6:15
a.m.
on
2017-01-16
.

Patient
's
family
was
notified
and
declined
autopsy
.

Given
the
sudden
unexpected
nature
of
patient
's
death
,
the
medical
examiner
was
contacted
and
the
case
was
accepted
.

Of
note
at
time
of
death
,
patient
was
DNR
/
DNI
.

This
was
initiated
after
several
conversations
with
the
patient
's
mother
,
who
stated
that
the
patient
had
desired
to
be
DNR
/
DNI
for
many
years
,
not
just
in
the
recent
past
.

These
facts
were
confirmed
via
separate
conversations
with
both
the
patient
's
lawyer
and
her
primary
care
physician
.

TRAUMA
SER

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
20
year
old
driver
was
in
a
major
motor
vehicle
accident
and
brought
to
the
Emergency
Saints
Medical
Center
following
this
,
with
multiple
trauma
.

The
patient
was
an
unrestrained
driver
in
a
car
versus
tree
.

He
was
involved
in
a
long
extrication
with
a
blood
pressure
of
88
at
the
scene
.

Upon
extrication
from
the
vehicle
,
he
was
intubated
and
transported
to
the
Emergency
Room
.

He
was
tachycardic
with
an
initial
blood
pressure
of
120
/
palpable
.

A
groin
line
was
placed
and
the
patient
was
sedated
and
paralyzed
.

He
was
resuscitated
with
Crystalloid
and
remained
hemodynamically
stable
.

He
had
a
grossly
deformed
left
lower
extremity
.

On
examination
,
Belmont
Coma
Scale
was
6T
;
blood
pressure
was
120
/
palpable
with
a
heart
rate
of
122
.

The
trachea
was
midline
.

The
abdomen
was
soft
.

Rectal
was
heme
positive
with
normal
prostate
.

There
were
no
meatal
blood
.

The
left
femur
was
grossly
deformed
with
a
pinhole
opening
in
the
lateral
thigh
.

His
left
forearm
was
also
grossly
deformed
.

There
is
no
step-off
at
the
back
.

Admission
laboratories
included
a
hematocrit
of
43.3
and
white
blood
cell
count
of
25.2
,
normal
electrolytes
and
amylase
of
98
.

Arterial
blood
gas
showed
a
mild
metabolic
acidosis
.

Additional
assay
shows
slight
widening
of
the
mediastinum
on
chest
x-ray
.

The
CT
scan
of
the
head
and
chest
were
negative
.

There
was
a
small
liver
laceration
seen
on
the
A/P
pelvis
.

There
was
a
distal
ulnar
and
radial
fracture
as
well
as
a
left
mid-shaft
comminuted
fracture
of
the
femur
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

He
was
also
seen
by
the
Orthopedics
Service
and
Neurosurgical
Service
.

He
went
to
the
Operating
Room
quickly
and
had
an
intramedullary
rodding
of
the
femur
and
open
reduction
and
internal
fixation
of
the
radius
and
ulna
.

He
was
evaluated
by
Neurosurgery
for
his
head
injury
which
showed
multiple
contusions
in
the
frontal
lobe
.

He
was
extubated
on
postoperative
day
two
.

He
did
have
some
blood
loss
anemia
with
a
hematocrit
of
20.9
.

A
repeat
CT
scan
showed
no
change
.

He
was
begun
on
Physical
Therapy
but
remained
agitated
.

He
was
discharged
to
the
Floor
.

His
hematocrit
remained
stable
.

His
cervical
spine
was
cleared
.

The
patient
was
seen
by
Psychiatry
due
to
some
delirium
and
question
of
suicidal
ideation
.

He
was
also
evaluated
by
the
Neuro-Rehabilitation
Service
who
thought
that
he
had
a
post-head
injury
syndrome
with
diffuse
cognitive
deficits
.

He
continued
to
have
some
episodes
of
agitation
which
were
treated
with
medication
.

He
required
some
sedation
and
restraint
and
was
begun
on
whatever
Physical
Therapy
he
could
have
given
his
head
injury
.

He
was
continued
to
be
followed
by
Psychiatry
and
then
was
casted
by
Orthopedics
.

He
continued
to
have
episodes
of
confusion
.

He
removed
the
cast
that
had
been
placed
and
then
a
long-leg
cast
was
then
placed
so
it
would
be
difficult
for
him
to
remove
or
to
ambulate
on
his
leg
,
which
might
jeopardize
his
closure
.

It
continued
to
be
somewhat
difficult
to
control
his
activity
and
Rehabilitation
Screen
was
in
place
but
there
was
difficulty
finding
the
appropriate
facility
.

His
family
was
also
involved
in
his
care
and
orientation
.

He
does
of
BuSpar
,
Trazodone
and
Haldol
were
continued
and
were
adjusted
by
Psychiatry
.

He
was
continued
on
observation
and
sitters
and
finally
became
more
docile
and
cooperative
.

He
was
continued
on
Physical
Therapy
and
with
his
mother
present
,
he
began
to
follow
commands
much
more
appropriately
and
was
able
to
be
rehabilitated
.

He
was
finally
sent
home
for
home
rehabilitation
on
2011-02-23
.

use
.

The
patient
was
admitted
to
NVH
and
started
on
vancomycin
,
levofloxacin
and
Flagyl
.

Cultures
were
taken
.

Blood
cultures
were
done
for
a
possible
rectosigmoid
mass
or
fistula
and
a
CT
showed
questionable
abscess
versus
tumor
in
the
left
lower
quadrant
.

Blood
cultures
done
on

for
bilateral
stent
placement
,
resection
of
the
pelvic
mass
,
lysis
of
adhesions
,
left

She
had
a
PCEA
for
pain
,
then
a
Dilaudid
PCA
.

The
patient
was
anxious
with
depression
poorly
controlled
until
12/14/03
.

The
patient
was
seen
by

150
mg
p.o.
q.h.s.
,
trazadone
100
mg
q.h.s.
and
Ambien
10
mg
q.h.s.

2.
Cardiovascular
:

The
patient
has
baseline
hypertension
that
was
difficult
to
control
.

In
the
ICU
,
the
patient
was
on
enalapril
,
hydralazine
and
labetalol
.

After
a
Cardiology
consulton
12/13/03
,
the
patient
was
started
on
metoprolol
100
mg
p.o.
q.i.d.
,
lisinopril
10
mg
q.d.
,
hydrochlorothiazide
25
mg
q.d.
.

Hydralazine
was
stopped
.

Blood
pressure
stayed
high
with
an
SBP
in
the
170s
,
so
amlodipine
10
mg
q.d.
was
added
and
that
blood
pressure
was
still
elevated
.

At
the
time
of
transfer
to
the
________
Onc
Service
,
blood
pressure
was
within
the
normal
range
.

3.
Pulmonary
:

The
patient
was
extubated
on
11/22/03
.

Once
the
patient
was
extubated
,
after
the
third
surgery
,
the
patient
could
not
be
weaned
off
2
liters
of
nasal
cannula
and
was
to
______
to
20
breaths
per
minute
despite
nebulizer
treatment
.

The
patient
was
restarted
on
Advair
and
by
12/15/03
,
was
weaned
to
room
air
likely
an
effective
Advair
and
control
of
anxiety
and
psychiatric
issues
.

4.
GI
:

On
postoperative
day
4
,
after
the
initial
surgery
,
the
patient
had
increased
shortness
of
breath
and
tachycardia
with
abdominal
pain
.

A
chest
x-ray
revealed
increased
free
air
under
the
diaphragm
.

A
CT
revealed
a
large
amount
of
free
air
.

The
patient
was
taken
to
the
OR
on
postop
day
5
for
emergent
exploratory
laparotomy
that
disclosed
a
small
bowel
enterotomy
with
2
liters
of
bilious
fluid
within
the
peritoneum
.

On
postop
day
9
,
the
patient
had
a
similar
increased
abdominal
pain
episode
and
was
taken
back
to
the
operating
room
for
another
emergent
exploratory
laparotomy
revealing
another
peroration
at
the
site
of
previous
repair
.

Intraoperatively
,
the
patient
suffered
hypotension
with
induction
and
respiratory
insufficiency
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
ICU
intubated
with
stable
.

The
patient
was
kept
NPO
with
an
NG
tube
until
postop
day
14
and_____
started
on
clear
sips
with
TPN
for
nutritional
supplementation
.

The
patient
intermittently
tolerated
diet
advancement
,
but
then
would
vomit
and
would
have
the
NG
tube
replaced
.

The
patient
,
at
the
time
of
transfer
,
was
tolerating
clears
with
low
stoma
output
,
likely
to
tolerate
slow
advancement
.

The
patient
still
had
a
PICC
line
at
the
time
,
although
TPN
was
being
held
and
calorie
counts
were
done
to
evaluate
the
benefit
of
p.o.
nutrition
.

5.
GU
:

No
issues
.

The
patient
generally
had
good
urine
output
.

Presumably
,
should
follow
up
with
the
Urology
Clinic
for
removal
of
the
ureteral
stents
at
some
point
.

6.
Infectious
Disease
:

Blood
cultures
mentioned
previously
were
positive
for
C.
perfringens
.

The
patient
was
started
on
empiricvancomycin
,
levofloxacin
and
Flagyl
after
the
second
exploratory
laparotomy
.

She
was
started
on
vancomycin
,
levofloxacin
,
Flagyl
,
doxycycline
and
fluconazole
.

Blood
cultures
drawn
on
12/01/03
were
negative
.

JP
drain
was
cultured
on
12/11/03
along
with
aurine
culture
.

TLC
,
TIB
and
blood
culture
were
all
negative
.

These
were
cultured
because
the
patient
&apos;s
white
blood
count
was
increasing
to
the
mid
20s
without
fever
or
other
symptoms
for
explanation
.

The
patient
,
at
the
time
of
transfer
,
to
the
Gyn
/
Onc
Service
was
not

and
the
white
blood
cell
count
was
trending
down
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Shortness
of
breath
-
Though
the
patient
denied
shortness
of
breath
on
admission
,
a
progress
note
from

Norwood
nursing
facility
suggested
that
the
patient
had
been
having
shortness
of
breath
and
cough
for
approximately
one
day
with
difficulty
ambulating
,
needing
to
travel
in
a
wheelchair
.

The
patient
was
afebrile
on
admission
with
a
normal
white
blood
cell
count
but
had
significant
wheezing
and
rales
on
physical
examination
with
a
possible
left
lower
lobe
opacity
seen
on
chest
x-ray
.

The
etiology
of
the
patient
's
shortness
of
breath
was
considered
a
likely
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
exacerbation
and
the
patient
was
started
on
Albuterol
and
Atrovent
nebulizers
.

The
patient
was
also
started
on
Doxycycline
given
the
concern
for
pneumonia
on
chest
x-ray
.

She
was
also
continued
on
steroids
given
evidence
of
severe
airway
obstruction
.

The
patient
's
shortness
of
breath
was
also
considered
possibly
related
to
a
coronary
event
and
she
was
admitted
for
rule
out
myocardial
infarction
.

The
patient
's
enzymes
were
cycled
and
were
negative
.

The
patient
's
electrocardiogram
performed
on
hospital
day
number
two
was
concerning
for
2:1
heart
block
and
the
cardiology
consult
service
was
contacted
for
evaluation
.

The
patient
was
taken
to
the
Coronary
Care
Unit
late
on
hospital
day
number
two
and
received
a
temporary
wire
.

The
following
day
the
patient
received
a
permanent
dual
chamber
rate
responsive
pacemaker
.

The
patient
was
transferred
back
to
the
general
medicine
service
where
she
continued
to
exhibit
signs
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
exacerbation
and
nebulizers
,
steroids
and
antibiotics
were
continued
.

The
patient
's
respiratory
status
improved
throughout
the
remainder
of
her
hospitalization
and
oxygen
was
eventually
weaned
.

Once
the
patient
was
transferred
out
of
the
Coronary
Care
Unit
,
she
appeared
to
have
an
element
of
heart
failure
in
addition
to
her
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
.

She
was
given
20
mg
of
intravenous
Lasix
with
impressive
urine
output
and
improvement
in
her
overall
fluid
status
.

The
patient
was
eventually
restarted
on
her
outpatient
dose
of
Lasix
once
her
renal
function
improved
to
baseline
and
remained
hemodynamically
stable
throughout
the
remainder
of
her
hospitalization
.

Heart
block
-
As
noted
previously
,
the
patient
's
electrocardiogram
was
significant
for
a
2:1
heart
block
and
cardiology
consult
service
was
contacted
for
evaluation
.

The
patient
received
a
temporary
pacing
wire
on
the
evening
of
hospital
day
number
two
and
on
hospital
day
number
three
received
a
dual
chamber
pacemaker
.

Renal
-
The
patient
was
admitted
with
a
creatinine
of
1.8
,
considered
likely
secondary
to
hypovolemia
.

Her
calculated
fractional
excretion
of
sodium
was
0.13
percent
suggesting
a
prerenal
cause
.

The
patient
's
creatinine
improved
to
1.1
with
hydration
.

Once
the
patient
's
creatinine
had
improved
to
baseline
,
her
Lasix
and
ace
inhibitor
were
restarted
and
the
patient
's
creatinine
was
noted
to
be
stable
.

Gastrointestinal
-
The
patient
was
admitted
with
a
history
of
gastrointestinal
bleed
with
guaiac
positive
stools
on
admission
.

Her
hematocrit
was
noted
to
trend
down
after
transfusion
of
one
unit
of
packed
red
blood
cells
on
admission
.

Given
guaiac
positive
stools
and
her
history
of
gastrointestinal
bleed
in
addition
to
use
of
steroids
for
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
exacerbation
,
the
gastroenterology
consult
service
was
contacted
.

The
results
of
that
consultation
and
potential
esophagogastroduodenoscopy
are
pending
at
the
time
of
dictation
.

Hypertension
-
The
patient
had
moderate
control
of
her
blood
pressure
throughout
her
admission
.

Her
calcium
channel
blocker
and
ace
inhibitor
were
continued
.

Hematology
-
As
noted
previously
,
the
patient
's
hematocrit
was
noted
to
drop
after
transfusion
with
one
unit
of
packed
red
blood
cells
on
admission
.

Given
guaiac
positive
stools
and
the
patient
's
history
of
gastrointestinal
bleed
,
gastroenterology
consult
service
was
contacted
for
possible
esophagogastroduodenoscopy
and/or
colonoscopy
.

The
results
of
this
consultation
are
pending
at
the
time
of
dictation
.

The
remainder
of
the
Hubbard
Regional
Hospital

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
20
year
old
black
female
who
was
a
pedestrian
when
struck
by
a
car
at

consciousness
at
the
scene
and
significant
deformity
of
the
anterior
portion
of
the
motorvehicle
with
positive
starring
of
the
windshield
.

The
patient
was
conscious
on
the
scene
when
evaluated
by
EMT
&apos;s
but
at
the
scene
,
the
patient
was
apparently
paraplegic
below
the
umbilicus
with
absence
of
movement
and
sensation
below
the
umbilicus
.

PAST
MEDICAL
HISTORY
:

None
.

PAST
SURGICAL
HISTORY
:

Status
post
laparotomy
for
an
ovarian
cyst
in
1988
.

MEDICATIONS
ON
ADMISSION
:

None
.

ALLERGIES
:

None
.

She
denies
cigarette
use
and
ethanol
use
as
well
as
a
recreational
drug
use
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

On
initial
exam
,
her
left
shoulder
was
tender
to
palpation
over
the
proximal
humerus
with
decreased
range
of
motion
.

She
was
without
the
ability
to
move
her
left
lower
extremity
with
decreased
sensation
in
the
left
leg
.

The
right
leg
was
with
decreased
range
of
motion
of
thigh
flexion
and
extension
.

The
back
was
notable
for
tenderness
at
the
level
of
L3-L5
.

LABORATORY
EXAMINATION
:

Initial
radiologic
evaluation
showed
negative
C-spine
,
thoracic
spine
,
and
lumbosacral
spine
films
.

Abdominal
CT
was
negative
except
for
right
hydronephrosis
with
mild
right
hydroureter
.

Back
MRI
was
negative
.

Film
of
the
left
humerus
was
also
negative
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

A
Neurosurgery
consultation
was
obtained
,
and
it
was
their
impression
that
the
patient
&apos;s
paraplegia
might
possibly
represent
a
cord
concussion
,
and
recommended
treatment
with
intravenous
steroids
for
24
hours
.

The
patient
&apos;s
paraplegia
resolved
by
the
morning
of
her
second
hospital
day
,
and
she
maintained
5/5
motor
strength
in
all
groups
.

A
Urology
consultation
was
obtained
,
and
it
was
recommended
that
an
IVP
be
obtained
.

This
was
obtained
on
the
day
of
discharge
,
however
,
due
to
residual
contrast
in
the
colon
from
the
patient
&apos;s
prior
abdominal
CT
scan
,
the
exam
was
postponed
after
a
scout
film
was
obtained
.

The
patient
fell
well
on
the
day
of
discharge
.

She
remained
afebrile
throughout
her
hospital
course
.

Additionally
on
the
night
before
discharge
,
flexion
and
extension
views
of
the
lumbosacral
spine
were
obtained
,
and
showed
no
fracture
or
instability
.

DISPOSITION
:

repeated
in
one
week
at
which
time
she
should
have
cleared
the
residual

.

The
baby
emerged
with
spontaneous
cry
,
received
routine
care
and
then
was
intubated
in
the
Delivery
Room
due
to

HOSPITAL
COURSE
BY
SYSTEM
:

Respiratory
:

The
baby
was
intubated
in
the
Delivery
Room
,
received
two
doses
of
surfactant
.

Radiograph
revealed
bilateral
diffuse
granular
pattern
consistent
with
surfactant
deficiency
.

Maximum
mechanical
ventilation
PIP
26
,
PEEP
6
,
rate
of
25
,
maximum
FIO2
35
percent
.

Mychelia
was
extubated
to
a
CPAP
of
6
cm
on
day
of
life
two
where
she
remained
until
day
of
life
20
.

On
day
of
life
two
,
she
was
also
loaded
with
caffeine
and
continues
on
caffeine
at
time
of
transfer
.

She
was
transitioned
to
a
nasal
cannula
on
day
of
life
20
and
remains
on
nasal
cannula
O2
100
percent
at
13
cc
flow
.

She
averaged
2-3
apnea
episodes
a
day
with
bradycardia
and
desaturations
.

She
has
a
comfortable
respiratory
rate
and
good
air
exchange
.

Cardiovascular
:

She
received
a
normal
saline
bolus
times
one
initially
for
poor
perfusion
and
was
started
on
dopamine
with
a
maximum
infusion
rate
of
6
mcg
per
kg
per
hour
.

This
was
discontinued
on
day
of
life
two
to
maintain
a
mean
arterial
pressure
of
greater
than
33
.

She
has
remained
hemodynamically
stable
during
the
remainder
of
her
hospitalization
here
.

Fluids
,
electrolytes
,
nutrition
:

Initially
maintained
NPO
.

UAC
and
UVC
lines
were
placed
upon
admission
to
the
CMED
.

The
UAC
was
left
in
place
until
day
of
life
two
and
was
removed
after
wean
from
dopamine
.

UVC
remained
in
place
through
day
of
life
six
and
was
utilized
to
administer
parenteral
nutrition
.

Electrolytes
and
glucose
remained
in
the
normal
range
throughout
the
first
week
.

She
was
started
on
enteral
feeds
on
day
of
life
six
with
a
slow
advance
secondary
to
increased
abdominal
girth
which
was
felt
to
be
due
to
CPAP
.

She
passed
meconium
.

She
achieved
full
feeds
on
day
of
life
13
.

Calories
were
gradually
increased
to
breast
milk
30
calories
with
ProMod
consisting
of
four
of
human
milk
fortifier
,
four
of
MCT
and
two
of
Polycose
with
a
12-28
teaspoon
of
ProMod
per
50
ml
of
breast
milk
or
60
ml
of
formula
.

On
day
of
life
six
due
to
concerns
for
hyperglycemia
and
abdominal
distention
,
sepsis
evaluation
was
obtained
.

She
was
noted
at
this
time
to
have
hyperglycemia
requiring
two
subcutaneous
doses
of
insulin
and
a
decreased
glucose
infusion
rate
to
achieve
euglycemia
.

This
resolved
that
same
day
.

Urine
output
was
always
noted
to
be
of
sufficient
quantity
.

Gastrointestinal
:

Mychelia
demonstrated
slow
gastrointestinal
motility
and
abdominal
distention
felt
to
be
due
to
CPAP
.

She
was
slow
to
advance
on
enteral
feeds
and
gradually
attained
full
enteral
volume
on
day
of
life
13
.

On
day
of
life
15
,
she
was
made
NPO
for
a
distended
abdomen
and
a
bilious
spit
.

Serial
KUBs
revealed
nonspecific
changes
with
dilated
loops
.

No
pneumatosis
or
free
air
was
seen
.

She
was
noted
to
have
bluish
discoloration
thought
to
perhaps
be
a
bruise
on
her
left
lower
quadrant
.

There
was
no
radiographic
correlation
with
this
.

Feeds
were
restarted
.

Again
,
she
was
advanced
to
full
volume
but
was
made
NPO
on
day
of
life
20
for
abdominal
distention
.

This
NPO
was
temporary
for
that
day
and
she
then
resumed
feedings
and
has
been
tolerating
full
enteral
feeds
well
,
improved
since
off
of
CPAP
,
passing
normal
stools
,
guaiac
negative
.

Mychelia
was
also
treated
for
physiologic
jaundice
.

She
was
started
under
phototherapy
on
day
of
life
one
through
day
of
life
three
with
a
peak
serum
bilirubin
of
4.7/0.3
.

This
issue
resolved
.

Hematologic
and
Infectious
Disease
:

Initial
CBC
was
notable
for
a
white
count
of
5.5
with
49
polys
,
1
band
and
47
lymphs
.

Initial
hematocrit
was
46.3
percent
and
platelets
320,000
.

Her
initial
blood
culture
remained
negative
and
she
received
48
hours
of
ampicillin
and
gentamicin
.

As
previously
noted
on
day
of
life
six
with
hyperglycemia
,
abdominal
distention
,
a
CBC
and
blood
culture
were
again
obtained
revealing
a
white
count
of
9.1
with
30
polys
,
0
bands
and
58
lymphs
.

Hematocrit
at
that
time
was
noted
to
be
31
and
platelets
370,000
.

Blood
culture
grew
staph
coagulase
negative
and
the
baby
received
seven
days
of
vancomycin
and
gentamicin
.

A
lumbar
puncture
was
also
performed
to
rule
out
meningitis
.

This
culture
remained
negative
with
normal
cell
counts
and
chemistries
.

Antibiotic
levels
were
monitored
and
doses
adjusted
accordingly
.

Mychelia
required
two
transfusions
during
her
hospital
stay
.

On
day
of
life
15
for
a
hematocrit
of
29
,
she
received
20
cc
of
packed
red
blood
cells
.

She
started
on
iron
and
vitamin
E
supplements
on
day
of
life
25
and
continues
on
that
at
this
time
of
transfer
.

However
,
on
day
of
life
34
,
12-04
,
she
was
noted
to
be
pale
and
less
stress
tolerant
,
mottling
easily
with
care
.

A
hematocrit
and
reticulocyte
count
showed
a
hematocrit
of
23
percent
and
a
reticulocyte
count
of
1.9
percent
.

Therefore
,
with
blood
available
from
the
first
aliquot
,
a
second
20
cc
per
kg
of
packed
red
blood
cells
were
infused
without
incident
.

Neurological
:

Initial
head
ultrasound
on
day
of
life
seven
was
normal
.

At
one
month
of
age
,
on
12-03
,
she
was
noted
to
have
an
absent
septum
pellucidum
.

An
MRI
obtained
and
reviewed
by
the
Hallmark
Health
System
Radiology
Department
revealed
focal
gyral
morphology
consistent
with
prematurity
,
normal
midline
structures
,
normal
myelination
,
no
lesions
,
no
signal
abnormalities
or
extracerebral
collections
.

The
cortical
ribbon
is
intact
.

The
major
vascular
structures
at
the
skull
base
are
normal
.

The
septal
leaflets
may
be
partially
absent
,
but
there
are
no
coronal
images
provided
for
confirmation
and
the
pituitary
stalk
is
present
.

An
Ophthalmology
consult
was
obtained
to
determine
the
presence
of
optic
nerves
.

These
were
both
determined
to
be
present
and
intact
.

Endocrine
was
also
consulted
.

Several
labs
were
ordered
.

Electrolytes
and
thyroid
studies
were
noted
to
be
in
the
normal
range
with
serum
sodium
of
136
,
potassium
4.7
,
chloride
98
and
CO2
34
.

She
had
a
calcium
of
10.3
,
a
phosphorus
of
4.8
and
alkaline
phosphatase
of
440
.

Thyroid
function
studies
revealed
a
TSH
of
2.2
,
T4
of
5.7
,
T3
of
101
and
a
cortisol
level
of
43
,
all
within
the
normal
range
.

A
growth
hormone
was
sent
and
the
results
were
pending
at
time
of
transfer
.

In
addition
,
an
FSH
and
LH
were
obtained
on
12-10
and
results
are
pending
at
time
of
transfer
.

Please

's
neurologic
examination
is
appropriate
for
corrected
gestational
age
which
is
33
and
6/7
weeks
on
day
of

.

By
mother
's
report
,
a
maternal
cousin
also
has
an
absent
septum
pellucidum
.

Given

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1.
Colitis
.

The
patient
has
a
history
of
ischemic
bowel
status
post
SMA
Percutaneous
Transluminal
Coronary
Angioplasty
with
recent
admission
for
gram
negative
rod
urosepsis
complicated
by
C.
difficile
colitis
.

The
patient
received
a
full
course
of
Flagyl
and
was
C.
difficile
toxin
negative
times
three
prior
to
transfer
.

He
now
returns
with
fever
,
rising
white
count
,
diarrhea
,
and
dehydration
.

Initially
treated
with
intravenous
ceftizoxime
,
gentamicin
,
and
Flagyl
for
presumed
sepsis
,
either
with
urine
or
bowel
source
.

He
was
also
started
on
p.o.
Vancomycin
.

Blood
cultures
and
urine
cultures
came
back
negative
.

Stool
for
C.
difficile
returned
positive
.

The
diagnosis
,
therefore
,
was
relapsed
C.
difficile
colitis
.

Intravenous
antibiotics
were
discontinued
and
the
patient
was
continued
on
p.o.
Vancomycin
.

He
improved
clinically
with
defervescence
,
decreased
white
blood
cell
count
to
10,000
with
resolution
of
left
shift
,
and
some
decrease
in
abdominal
distention
on
exam
.

An
abdominal
CAT
scan
revealed
thickened
bowel
wall
and
thumb
printing
,
primarily
involving
the
cecum
and
right
colon
greater
than
the
left
,
consistent
with
C.
difficile
colitis
.

The
diagnosis
of
recurrent
bowel
ischemia
,
however
,
was
not
ruled
out
and
this
will
continue
to
be
a
concern
in
the
future
.

The
patient
was
initially
n.p.o.
and
was
then
advanced
to
clear
liquids
which
he
tolerated
.

He
will
be
advanced
to
soft
solids
prior
to
discharge
.

2.
Azotemia
.

The
patient
has
chronic
renal
insufficiency
with
baseline
creatinine
1.8-2
.

Creatinine
had
risen
to
4.3
on
admission
presumed
secondary
to
sepsis
and
dehydration
.

With
intravenous
hydration
the
BUN
and
creatinine
fell
to
12/1.9
which
is
within
normal
limits
for
this
patient
.

The
abdominal
CAT
scan
showed
no
evidence
of
hydronephrosis
orrenal
abscess
.

3.
Mental
status
.

The
patient
was
alert
and
oriented
throughout
the
admission
;
however
,
by
personality
,
he
is
somewhat
cantankerous
and
demanding
of
the
nurses
.

He
was
written
for
Haldol
1
mg
p.o.b.i.d.
p.r.n.
to
help
with
this
problem
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

This
patient
was
admitted
on
08-04
after
a
recent
discharge
from
the
hospital
for
sudden
onset
of
left
sided
abdominal
pain
.

In
the
emergency
room
,
his
ultrasound
showed
mild
hydronephrosis
with
new
perinephric
fluid
surrounding
the
transplant
kidney
and
hence
,
underwent
a
CT
scan
of
his
abdomen
/
pelvis
which
showed
a
large
left-sided
of
retroperitoneal
hemorrhage
extending
down
to
the
level
of
the
renal
transplant
possibly
related
to
recent
transplant
biopsy
.

Renal
transplant
medicine
and
transplant
surgery
were
made
aware
and
the

there
is
no

.

There
are
bilateral

have
increased
in
size
since
the

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

79F
w/
a
multiple
medical
problems
including
Sylvia
(
EF20%
)
,
COPD
(
on
home
O2
)
,
found
down
at
home
,
pulseless
-
CPR
initiated
w/conciousness
regained
on
scene
.

At
OSH
ABG
7.19/94/110
,
BiPAP
started
.

Pt
found
to
be
hypothermic
w/
WBC
17
(
pt
on
steroids
)
pnuemobilia
and
thickening
of
sigmoid
.

Pt
was
transferred
to
The
Hospital
for
Orthopedics
for
further
management
with
wishes
from
the
pt
and
family
to
reverse
DNR/DNI
status
if
surgery
was
indicated
.

On
transfer
,
the
pt
had
VSS
with
a
mildly
tender
abdomen
without
peritoneal
signs
.

It
was
decided
to
treat
her
conservatively
with
bowel
and
IV
antibiotics
.

She
improved
and
was
tolerating
PO
's
without
difficulty
after
passing
a
swallow
study
.

Her
Cpine
was
clearly
with
both
a
negative
CT
Cspine
and
clinical
exam
.

Her
groin
CVL
was
DC
'd
after
a
L
SC
SVL
was
palced
.

CXR
confirmed
good
position
and
no
PTx
.

Overnight
on
HD
3
,
pt
became
mildly
agitated
and
an
ABG
was
drawn
which
showed
a
severe
resp
acidosis
and
BiPAP
was
initiated
.

The
pt
subsequently
developed
severe
hypoxia
with
hypotension
.

A
CXR
was
obtained
which
showed
complete
collapse
of
the
L
lung
thought
to
be
a
result
of
bursting
a
bleb
associated
with
her
severe
COPD
.

Family
did
not
want
a
chest
tube
placed
and
decided
to
make
the
pt
CMO
measures
.

On
HD
4
pt
continued
to
show
a
severe
respiratory
acidosis
,
was
continued
on
a
morphine
drip
,
and
was
difficult
to
arouse
.

At
6pm
pt
's
respiratory
status
worsened
and
she
died
.

CT
head
without
contrast
2013-11-11
:

FINDINGS
:

There
is
a
large
region
of
high
attenuation
within
the
right
frontal
lobe
and
the
region
of
the
right
basal
ganglia
.

This
is
consistent
with
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage
,
more
likely
hypertensive
in
etiology
.

No
significant
subarachnoid
or
intraventricular
hemorrhage
is
appreciated
.

There
is
mass
effect
present
with
shift
of
the
normally
midline
structures
towards
the
left
.

There
is
also
left
sided
subfalcine
herniation
.

There
is
no
hydrocephalus
.

The
visualized
osseous
structures
and
paranasal
sinuses
are
unremarkable
.

IMPRESSION
:

Large
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage
within
the
right
frontal
lobe
.

This
most
likely
relates
to
hypertensive
hemorrhage
,
as
opposed
to
a
ruptured
right
middle
cerebral
artery
aneurysm
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Patient
was
a
75
year
old
right
handed
male
with
past
medical
history
of
atrial
fibrillation
on
coumadin
,
coronary
artery
disease
,
hyperlipidemia
,
dementia
with
sudden
onset
left
sided
weakness
,
dysarthria
.

Head
CT
demonstrated
a
large
right
intracerebral
hemorrhage
,
centered
around
basal
ganglia
and
putamen
.

We
felt
this
was
likely
secondary
to
hypertension
.

While
still
in
the
emergency
department
,
he
had
rapid
decompensation
necessitating
intubation
for
airway
protection
.

Examination
post
intubation
but
off
intubations
showed
clinical
evidence
of
elevated
intracranial
pressure
and
brainstem
compression
.

The
overall
prognosis
was
guarded
.

He
was
admitted
to
the
Neurology
/
Neurosurgery
ICU
.

He
was
loaded
with
Mannitol
and
Dilantin
in
the
emergency
room
.

He
was
evaluated
by
the
Neurosurgery
service
and
they
did
not
feel
a
surgical
intervention
or
ventriculary
drain
was
warranted
.

After
arrival
in
the
ICU
,
patient
was
followed
with
neuro
checks
every
1
hour
.

Sedation
was
held
to
allow
for
frequent
exams
.

Head
of
bed
was
kept
at
30
degrees
.

Labetalol
continuous
infusion
was
titrated
for
systolic
blood
pressure
of
130-160
.

Mannitol
and
Dilantin
were
continued
.

After
lengthy
discussion
,
the
patient
's
wife
opted
to
make
him
DNR
on
afternoon
of
2013-11-11
.

Overnight
,
fresh
frozen
plasma
was
given
for
goal
INR
of
<
1.4
.

On
serial
exams
by
neurology
and
ICU
attendings
in
the
morning
on
2013-11-12
,
patient
had
no
clinical
signs
of
brainstem
activity
.

Namely
,
he
was
unresponsive
.

Pupils
were
fixed
and
dilated
.

No
corneal
,
gag
,
oculocephalic
,
and
oculovestibular
reflexes
were
elicited
.

He
was
not
overbreathing
his
ventilator
.

At
this
point
,
patient
was
felt
to
have
clinical
signs
consistent
with
brain
death
.

Plans
were
made
to
proceed
with
apnea
testing
.

However
,
after
discussion
with
patient
's
wife
,
this
was
postponed
with
test
planned
on
2013-11-13
.

Full
medical
care
and
managment
continued
overnight
11/9-11/20/2002
.

At
approximately
06:00
on
2013-11-13
,
the
patient
became
bradycardic
.

He
lapsed
first
into
a
junctional
rhythm
and
then
had
very
infrequent
ventricular
escape
beats
on
telemetry
.

Finally
,
he
went
asystolic
.

He
was
not
resuscitated
as
per
previous
conversations
with
his
wife
.

Ronald
was
pronounced
dead
at
06:59
am
.

The
patient
's
wife
was
notified
.

The
attending
was
notified
as
well
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Impression
:

71
yo
m
w/
astrocytoma
on
xrt
and
chemotx
,
who
p/w
1
wk
h/o
productive
cough
,
sick
contact
,
hypoxic
,
now
intubated
,
w/
increasing
infiltrates
b/l
.

1)
Resp
failure
-
pt
admitted
w/
primarily
hypoxic
respiratory
failure
.

Following
admission
to
the
floor
the
pt
developed
increasing
hypoxia
and
somnolence
,
requiring
intubation
on
HD
5
.

Pulm
had
previously
been
consulted
and
felt
that
presentation
was
c/w
PCP
,
Joann
started
on
Bactrim
.

Previously
treated
for
CAP
as
outpt
but
hypoxia
continued
to
progress
.

Similar
lack
of
improvement
w/
additional
broad
spectrum
coverage
following
admission
.

Pt
underwent
bronchoscopy
on
11-22
following
transfer
to
the
ICU
for
hypoxic
respiratory
failure
and
intubation
(
7.25/52/70
on
100%
NRB
)
.

On
admission
to
the
ICU
the
pt
'
steroid
dose
was
increased
to
8
mg
bid
03-07
to
a
dead
space
measurement
of
50%
.

Pt
did
well
in
the
ICU
,
w/
his
respiratory
status
steadily
improving
and
was
extubated
on

01-03
.

He
was
subsequently
tranferred
to
the
floor
,
where
he
continued
to
have
a
stable
oxygen
requirement
.

Repeat
CXR
was
unchanged
from
previously
in
the
ICU
(
official
read
noted
mild
CHF
,
but
pt
was
continuing
to
autodiurese
and
has
remained
net
negative
everyday
while
on
the
floor
.

On
discharge
the
patient
has
stable
O2
req
,
90%
on
RA
.

2)
astrocytoma
-
grade
II
,
as
per
d/w
PMD
,
Dr.
Holscher
,
pt
has
poor
prognosis
,
but
reasonable
for
ongoing
treatment
.

Pt
has
had
two
recent
neg
head
CT
s
,
so
unlikely
the
etiology
of
the
patient
's
MS
change
.

Pt
was
continued
on
keppra
during
admission
for
sz
px
.

Initially
he
had
been
on
lamotrigine
but
the
was
stopped
in
10/12
when
the
pt
was
noted
to
be
developing
a
new
rash
.

Decadron
has
been
steadily
tapered
since
arrival
on
the
floor
.

Now
continued
on
1
mg
BID
,
to
complete
a
7
day
course
,
which
will
be
tapered
to
1
mg
qday
on
01-15
,
and
subsequently
to
0.5
mg
qday
x
7
days
then
to
be
discontinued
.

The
patient
's
keppra
should
be
continued
for
sz
prophylaxis
.

3)
MS
change
-
on
admission
pt
was
agitated
,
requiring
restraints
and
antipsychotics
,
however
as
he
became
increasingly
hypoxic
he
became
somnolent
.

In
the
ICU
the
pt
remained
stuporous
,
responsive
to
painful
stimuli
.

On
the
floor
the
patient
intially
was
imporved
,
but
has
plateaued
,
responding
to
simple
commands
and
verbalizing
groans
but
no
real
speech
.

Improvement
has
correlated
w/
tapering
of
steroids
,
one
of
the
causes
in
the
differential
.

Pt
had
multiple
head
CT
s
which
ruled
out
progression
of
astrocytoma
.

MRI
has
been
deferred
given
that
the
pt
currently
would
not
tolerate
the
procedure
.

EEG
was
w/o
evidence
of
epileptiform
activity
and
c/w
toxic
encephalopathy
.

Plan
to
continue
to
follow
MS
,
expect
improvement
as
steroids
are
continued
to
be
tapered
.

4)
h/o
DVT
-
cont
heparin
,
previously
on
enoxaparin
x10
days
at
treatment
dose
,
followed
by
prophylactic
dose
.

On
admission
,
the
pt
was
started
on
treatment
doses
of
enoxaparin
.

Upon
transfer
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
the
pt
was
started
on
heparin
gtt
.

Course
was
c/b
one
episode
of
gross
hematochezia
on
12-28
,
w/
concomitant
hct
drop
of
~
3
pts
.

B/L
lower
ext
duplex
us
and
a
cta
were
performed
,
both
of
which
were
negative
.

Given
that
the
pt
was
w/o
evidence
of
DVT
it
was
felt
that
the
risks
of
anticoagulation
in
the
setting
of
gross
GIB
,
outweigh
the
risks
of
undetected
deep
vv
thrombosis/pe
.

Pt
was
continued
on
prophylactic
heparin
.

4)
hypersensitivity
reaction
-
on
11-24
pt
was
noted
to
have
developing
rash
of
abdomen
and
anterior
thighs
.

Derm
initially
reviewed
and
thought
that
it
was
not
c/w
hypersensitivity
rxn
.

Over
the
next
the
rash
progressed
,
and
the
patient
subsequently
began
spiking
fevers
to
approx
103
F
,
c/b
hypotension
requiring
aggressive
fluid
repletion
and
pressors
,
and
tachycardia
to
the

130s
.

The
patient
also
developed
elevated
transaminases
and
pancreatic
enzymes
during
this
time
.

On
the
second
day
that
the
rash
had
been
noted
,
Derm
was
asked
to
see
again
,
felt
c/w
hypersensitivity
,
bactrim
was
switched
to
pentamidine
,
and
lamictal
was
held
.

Pt
continued
to
have
elev
pancreatic
enzymes
and
pentamidine
was
switched
to
clinda/primaquine
.

Following
discontinuation
of
the
bactrim
the
patient
defervesced
,
and
remained
normotensive
.

He
received
one
dose
of
furosemide
in
the
ICU
and
was
transferred
to
the
floor
the
next
day
.

On
arrival
to
the
floor
the
patient
was
noted
to
have
a
lacy
reticular
rash
of
upper
arms
,
which
resolved
over
the
next
48h
.

Felt
likely
03-07
the
sulfa
moiety
of

furosemide
.

Plan
for
pt
to
complete

will
be
completed
on

Her
hematocrit
was
measured
at
23.5
,
while
her
baseline
hematocrit
is
in
the
low
30
s.

An
NG
lavage
was
performed
and
there
was
bilious
return
.

Rectal
examination
was
notable
for
guiaiac
positive
maroon
stool
.

She
was
type
and
crossed
and
transfused
two
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
.

IV
PPI
was
given
and
the
GI
team
was
consulted
and
she
was
scheduled
for
colonoscopy
and
EGD
on
the
morning
of

consult
team
followed
pt
in
hospital
.

On
discussion
with
Dr
Leigh
and
Dr
White
from
GI
-
they
recommended
that
she
follow
with
Dr.
Taylor
for
consideration
of
argon
photocoagulation
as
out-patient
.

Given
the
innumerable
number
of
AVM
's
,
it
is
diffcult
to
assess
which
the
culprit
lesion
is
and
GI
may
start
APL

.

reconstruction
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
68
year
old
female
had
rheumatic
fever
in
the
past
,
and
has
had
chronic
atrial
fibrillation
.

She
has
had
progressive
heart
failure
and
an
evaluation
demonstrated
worsening
mitral
stenosis
with
severe
pulmonary
hypertension
.

Because
of
her
deteriorating
status
,
she
underwent
prior
cardiac
catheterization
,
which
confirmed
severe
mitral
stenosis
with
secondary
tricuspid
valve
regurgitation
due
to
pulmonary
hypertension
.

She
was
referred
for
valve
surgery
.

PAST
MEDICAL
HISTORY
is
remarkable
for
chronic
lung
disease
due
to
smoking
.

She
had
undergone
a
previous
nasal
arterial
embolization
for
treatment
of
recurrent
epistaxis
.

She
had
a
partial
gastrectomy
in
1972
.

Her
MEDICATIONS
ON
ADMISSION
included
Coumadin
,
digoxin
,
0.125
,
qD
,
Lasix
,
40
,
q.i.d.
,
and
Vanceril
inhaler
.

PERTINENT
EXAMINATION
demonstrated
mild
elevation
of
her
jugular
venous
pulse
,
with
prominent
V-waves
,
and
systolic
and
diastolic
murmurs
.

Peripheral
pulses
were
all
intact
,
and
there
was
venous
stasis
changes
on
her
legs
,
with
some
edema
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
brought
to
the
Operating
Room
,
on
April
22
.

She
underwent
a
mitral
valve
replacement
,
utilizing
a
27
mm
.

St.
Jude
prosthesis
,
and
tricuspid
valve
reconstruction
by
ring
anuloplasty
.

She
weaned
from
cardiopulmonary
bypass
with
good
hemodynamics
.

She
initially
awoke
after
surgery
,
with
good
hemodynamics
.

She
was
transiently
in
sinus
rhythm
,
but
atrial
fibrillation
recurred
.

She
was
extubated
on
the
third
postoperative
day
,
and
was
initially
slightly
agitated
and
confused
,
largely
due
to
an
Intensive
Care
Unit
psychosis
.

She
continued
to
improve
,
with
mobilization
of
fluid
.

She
was
initially
noted
to
have
a
slow
ventricular
response
in
atrial
fibrillation
,
but
this
gradually
improved
over
time
.

She
was
initially
noted
to
be
somewhat
anemic
,
and
received
transfusions
.

Coumadin
was
restarted
,
and
her
anticoagulation
came
into
range
.

She
was
ultimately
discharged
with
a
heart
rate
in
the
90
's
,
and
with
resolving
edema
and
a
clear
chest
.

Her
MEDICATIONS
ON
DISCHARGE
included
Lasix
,
40
,
b.i.d.
,
potassium
,
20

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
68
year
old
female
has
rheumatic
heart
disease
.

Mitral
and
possibly
tricuspid
valve
surgery
is
scheduled
for
Labor
Day
by
Dr.
Riemund
C.
Kennedy
.

Her
history
is
detailed
in
the
discharge
summary
of
August
10
of
this
year
.

She
is
admitted
now
for
a
neuro-interventional
radiology
procedure
to
decrease
the
likelihood
of
epistaxis
on
Coumadin
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

Chest
was
clear
.

Right
neck
and
right
groin
catheterization
sites
were
benign
.

No
edema
.

Examination
was
otherwise
unchanged
.

LABORATORY
DATA
:

Hematocrit
was
42
,
PT
was

,
potassium
was
3.6
,
BUN
was
29
,

.

EKG
showed
atrial
fibrillation
,
moderate
ventricular
response
,
right
ventricular
hypertrophy
,

.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
interventional
neuro-radiology
procedure
was
performed
by
Dr.
A
Skizeis
,
on
August
22
,
via
the
right
femoral
artery
.

The
right
internal
maxillary
artery
supply
to
the
nasal
mucosa
was
embolized
.

The
left
external
carotid
artery
was
occluded
at
its
origin
,
with
collaterals
from
the
internal
carotid
artery
.

Thus
,
embolization
on
the
left
side
was
not
possible
.

The
patient
received
Coumadin
,
10
mg.
,
on
the
evening
following
the
procedure
,
and
is
discharged
the
next
day
.

Her
prothrombin
time
will
be
rechecked
on
August
27
by
her
primary
care
physician
,
Dr.
Naka
Gift
.

Once
her
prothrombin
time
is
in
therapeutic
range
,
she
will
be
observed
for
epistaxis
.

She
will
take
her
last
dose
of
Coumadin
on
September
1
in
anticipation
of
cardiac
surgery
.

If
her
prothrombin
time
does
not
come
into
therapeutic
range
promptly
,
then
surgery
may
be
delayed
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
49
year
old
woman
with
a
metastatic
adenocarcinoma
of
the
breast
who
is
status
post
high
dose
chemotherapy
with
PBSE
and
CCSS
support
ending
June
1994
.

She
was
admitted
on
1-5-94
for
fever
,
chest
wall
ulceration
,
cellulitis
and
pain
control
.

The
patient
first
presented
in
October
1991
with
a
tender
right
axillary
mass
.

A
mammogram
done
in
November
1990
was
negative
.

However
,
mammography
repeated
in
October
1991
showed
bilateral
breast
masses
,
suspicious
for
carcinoma
.

Fine
needle
aspiration
on
October
23
,
1991
demonstrated
atypical
cells
which
occurred
singly
and
in
clusters
.

Staging
evaluation
included
normal
liver
function
tests
,
normal
blood
counts
and
normal
chest
x-ray
.

Bone
scan
showed
degenerative
joint
disease
in
the
shoulders
and
lumbar
spine
as
well
as
increased
radio
chaser
uptake
in
the
breast
bilaterally
.

Dr.
Berca
Gachfrum
performed
a
right
modified
mastectomy
and
left
simple
mastectomy
on
November
4
,
1991
.

The
right
modified
radical
mastectomy
contained
a
5.5
cm
poorly
differentiated
,
Grade
III
out
of
III
infiltrating
ductal
carcinoma
.

The
margins
were
free
of
tumor
,
but
10
out
of
21
lymph
nodes
were
positive
for
metastatic
carcinoma
.

Furthermore
there
was
a
mass
on
the
right
pectoralis
muscle
which
is
supposed
to
be
metastatic
cancer
.

The
left
simple
mastectomy
also
contained
5.5
cm
poorly
differentiated
infiltrating
ductal
and
intraductal
carcinoma
with
extensive
lymphatic
vessel
invasion
.

Estrogen
receptor
was
0%
by
ERICA
.

The
patient
developed
a
large
hematoma
requiring
surgical
drainage
.

Therefore
she
had
a
Stage
III-A
adenocarcinoma
of
the
breast
.

Since
she
was
at
high
risk
for
both
local
and
metastatic
recurrence
of
her
tumor
,
she
received
both
systemic
chemotherapy
and
radiation
therapy
.

The
patient
was
treated
with
CMSAP
,
which
is
Cytoxan
,
Methotrexate
,
Leukovoranrescue
,
5-FU
,
Adriamycin
and
Prednisone
for
four
cycles
.

There
were
no
dose
reductions
for
mucositis
or
myelosuppression
.

However
,
following
cycle
4
,
she
developed
a
flu-like
illness
,
followed
by
fever
,
nonproductive
cough
and
dyspnea
on
exertion
.

ABGs
showed
a
pO2
of
79
,
pH
7.44
,
pO2
33
.

Chest
x-ray
showed
diffuse
interstitial
infiltrates
.

The
differential
diagnosis
included
viral
pneumonitis
,
Mycoplasma
,
Chlamydia
.

Basically
in
December
1993
,
she
returned
to
the
Hem
/
Onc
Clinic
with
chest
wall
nodules
which
turned
out
to
be
tumor
recurrences
and
biopsied
.

Although
she
had
mediastinal
recurrence
,
bone
scan
,
head
and
liver
CT
were
negative
for
metastatic
disease
.

She
was
thus
started
on
a
Protocol
of
high
dose
chemotherapy
with
GCSF
and
peripheral
stem
cell
support
.

Complications
has
mainly
included
myelosuppression
and
mucositis
.

She
also
developed
Klebsiella
UTI
after
the
second
cycle
of
high
dose
chemotherapy
.

It
was
treated
with
gent
and
Cipro
.

Re-staging
done
in
April
1993
showed
a
decrease
in
the
pretracheal
nodes
with
question
of
some
lymphangitic
spread
versus
some
pneumonitis
.

In
May
1994
she
received
her
first
course
of
thiotepa
and
Velban
and
Methotrexate
,
which
required
some
red
cell
transfusions
.

In
mid
May
she
was
admitted
for
fever
and
neutropenia
and
at
that
time
had
a
UTI
with
blood
clots
in
the
urine
.

The
patient
presents
today
with
complaints
of
fever
and
a
temperature
of
100
.

She
has
also
been
having
diarrhea
since
November
and
her
other
complaints
of
admission
include
confusion
,
nausea
and
vomiting
.

We
will
include
a
very
thorough
HPI
with
this
dictation
that
was
done
by
Dr.
Wedleung
.

-
Showed
a
left

adenopathy
and
small

with
no
evidence
of

.

In
summary
,
the
patient
is
a
49
year
old
woman
with
metastatic
breast
cell
CA
,
status
post
chemotherapy
with
CMSAP
and
PVSC
and
XRT
who
presented
with
fever
,
four
days
of
diarrhea
,
nausea
and
vomiting
and
had
been
on
Keflex
for
an
erythema
on
her
left
chest
wall
.

The
Keflex
was
stopped
when
she
developed
the
diarrhea
.

When
she
arrived
the
plan
was
to
go
ahead
and
treat
here
rythematous
induration
and
possible
cellulitis
with
IV
antibiotics
.

So
she
was
put
on
dicloxicillin
and
we
did
local
wound
care
with
an
agent
called
Santyl
,
which
is
a
collagenace
ondebrided
which
worked
very
well
for
her
.

Also
at
the
time
of
admission
we
were
also
considering
palliative
Taxol
chemotherapy
,
which
the
patient
declined
.

She
refused
the
Taxol
therapy
so
that
was
not
done
.

Another
major
issue
with
this
patient
was
pain
control
.

She
had
been
in
a
whole
lot
of
pain
from
her
left
arm
lesion
.

So
pain
control
was
a
big
issue
so
she
was
on
MS
Contin
and
MSIR
at
home
she
thought
that
clouded
her
thinking
,
so
we
tried
different
things
for
pain
management
.

One
of
them
was
to
do
a
subarachnoid
neurologic
block
at
C6-C7
interface
on
1-6-94
.

After
that
the
patient
had
minimal
relief
of
pain
.

However
,
she
declined
further
blocks
,
which
were
offered
to
her
.

So
accepted
to
be
on
dilaudid
p.o.
which
was
started
at
a
dosage
of
2-4
meg
but
since
then
we
have
tapered
it
up
.

She
is
now
getting
dilaudid
8
mg
q2h
and
in
addition
she
has
been
on
fentanyl
patch
.

She
is
now
getting
75
micrograms
per
hour
of
the
fentanyl
patch
which
is
changed
every
72
hours
.

We
can
go
up
by
25
mg
on
the
fentanyl
patch
as
needed
to
control
her
pain
and
we
can
always
go
up
on
the
dilaudid
because
she
is
still
in
considerable
amount
of
pain
.

Other
things
that
happened
during
this
admission
-
we
obtained
ahead
CT
for
her
on
the
8th
of
January
because
of
her
clouded
thinking
and
altered
mental
status
,
which
was
probably
due
to
the
morphine
that
she
was
taking
.

We
went
ahead
and
got
a
head
CT
scanand
it
showed
no
enhancing
lesions
.

In
addition
her
liver
transaminases
were
elevated
,
we
thought
about
doing
further
work-up
,
but
that
was
deferred
because
the
patient
wanted
to
wait
on
that
.

That
has
been
stable
.

The
patient
on
January
13
became
hyponatremic
.

Her
sodium
went
down
to
121
and
before
that
on
admission
she
was
133
.

A
renal
consult
was
obtained
and
their
assessment
was
that
this
was
probably
a
mixture
of
hypovolemia
as
well
as
SIADH
.

We
proceeded
to
do
for
her
hyponatremia
-
we
gave
her
some
fluid
and
her
urine
sodium
became
higher
than
her
serum
sodium
;
we
stopped
it
.

We
had
given
her
some
normal
saline
and
then
we
proceeded
to
just
do
fluid
restriction
.

In
addition
we
gave
her
a
sodium
chloride
one
gram
per
day
and
that
also
helped
,
so
that
now
at
the
time
of
discharge
,
the
patient
&apos;s
sodium
is
between
126
and
129
;
prior
to
that
it
had
gone
down
to
as
low
116.

So
that
has
really
improved
.

We
suggest
continuing
increased
salt
intake
in
her
diet
and
also
continuing
with
the
fluid
restriction
of
free
water
intake
to
one
liter
per
day
.

On
the
14th
of
January
,
the
patient
developed
increased
shortness
of
breath
and
chest
x-ray
was
taken
showed
a
wedge
shaped
infiltrate
in
the
right
upper
lobe
which
was
consistent
with
Hampton
&apos;s
hump
.

Also
a
VQ
scan
obtained
the
next
day
showed
high
probability
for
PE
.

So
we
proceeded
to
put
her
on
heparin
for
anticoagulation
and
then
when
she
was
therapeutic
on
heparin
,
we
went
ahead
and
started
her
on
coumadin
and
she
is
currently
on
coumadin
at
2.5
mg
q.h.s.

Her
INR
is
2.3
.

We
want
her
INR
to
remain
between
2
and
3
.

So
if
it
goes
much
lower
than
2
,
then
we
would
consider
increasing
it
to
perhaps
coumadin
2.5
and
5
alternating
every
other
night
.

However
,
we
would
leave
it
at
2.5
for
now
.

Other
major
issues
-
As
a
result
of
all
the
things
happened
and
with
her
hyponatremia
and
also
the
other
problems
,
her
blood
pressure
was
elevated
also
.

We
put
her
on
nifedipine
IR
,
SL
and
that
was
not
enough
to
control
her
blood
pressure
which
was
in
the
200s
in
the
systolic
,
so
we
had
started
her
on
atenolol
.

So
on
discharge
she
is
on
atenolol
100
.

If
needed
to
you
can
give
her
some
nifedipine
SL
to
decrease
her
blood
pressure
.

The
patient
also
has
significant
edema
in
both
arms
now
and
also
some
mild
edema
in
the
lower
extremities
,
so
I
think
that
fluid
restriction
should
help
with
that
.

She
is
also
a
little
dry
.

The
patient
is
on
oxygen
.

Ever
since
the
pulmonary
embolus
she
has
been
on
oxygen
.

She
was
on
4
liters
;
now
she
is
on
5
liters
,
sating
94
to
96%
on
5
liters
.

We
would
like
for
her
to
remain
on
the
oxygen
as
well
.

The
complications
that
I
have
listed
include
the
hyponatremia
,
pulmonary
embolus
and
also
the
elevatd
blood
pressure
.

CONDITION
ON
DISCHARGE
:

Fair
.

She
remains
very
weak
and
will
most
likely
benefit
from
some
physical
therapy
andshe
still
has
the
bilateral
edema
.

She
is
to
go
to
the
Necsoncardel
Medical
Center
for
more
chronic
care
.

Follow-up
is
with
Dr.
Wedleung
in
the
Hem
/
Onc

.

The
appointment
has
already
been
made
.

The
patient
is
very
limited
in
how
much
she
can
do
right
now
because
of
her
pain
primarily
and
her
difficulty
breathing
.

PAD-WORD

History
of
Present
Illness
:

The
patient
is
a
83
yo
R-handed
man
with
a
history
of
multiple
intracranial
hemorrhages
during
the
last
few
years
,
pacemaker
,
hyperlipidemia
,
arrhythmia
who
now
presents
with
gradual
decline
in
gait
and
slowing
of
mentation
over
the
last
week
.

The
patient
had
a
fall
about
ten
days
ago
,
when
he
was
walking
the
dog
.

The
leash
got
wrapped
around
his
legs
.

According
to
his
wife
he
had
a
small
abrasion
on
the
top
of
his
head
,
but
nothing
major
.

He
did
not
complain
about
a
headache
.

He
was
at
baseline
with
respect
to
his
gait
(
at
baseline
unsteady
,
though
he
refuses
to
walk
with
a
walker
)
and
his
mentation
(
at
baseline
difficulties
with
memory
since
months
;
keeps
forgetting
appointments
).

Then
about
a
week
ago
,
the
patient
and
his
wife
noted
that
his
gait
became
even
more
unsteady
,
though
he
did
not
fall
.

He
also
had
difficulties
navigating
through
his
apartment
,
having
difficulties
finding
the
fridge
for
example
.

They
were
concerned
that
the
fall
might
have
caused
another
bleed
,
as
had
happened
in
the
past
,
and
this
prompted
them
to
come
to
the
Deanna
.

No
headache
,
neckpain
,
nausea
,
vomiting
or
focal
weakness
/
numbness
.

are
identified
.

There
is
no
displacement
of
the
normally

,
hydrocephalus
,
or
effacement
of
the

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

The
patient
is
a
83
yo
man
with
a
history
of
past
intracranial
hemorrhages
(
most
recent
07-01
with
R-frontal
hemorrhage
)
who
presented
with
gradually
slowing
of
mentation
and
increased
gait
instability
since
one
week
.

On
initial
exam
the
patient
was
not
oriented
to
time
,
seemed
somewhat
slow
,
and
had
difficulties
generating
a
list
of
animals
.

His
cranial
nerves
and
strength
were
full
,
and
the
sensory
exam
showed
mildly
decreased
vibration
and
proprioception
in
both
LE
,
suggesting
peripheral
neuropathy
.

A
CT
was
performed
in
the
Deanna
that
showed
a
new
significant
R-frontal
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage
in
the
same
location
as
the
prior
bleed
.

The
patient
was
seen
by
both
neurology
and
neurosurgery
,
and
the
two
teams
agreed
that
the
etiology
seemed
to
be
related
to
underlying
amyloidosis
.

During
the
last
admission
the
question
of
a
mass
underlying
a
hemorrhage
in
the
R-frontal
region
was
raised
.

The
location
of
the
hemorrhage
was
not
felt
to
be
typical
for
hypertensive
bleed
(
cortical
)
and
it
was
felt
to
be
unlikely
that
the
recent
fall
was
related
to
the
bleed
.

The
patient
could
not
undergo
an
MRI
due
to
his
pacer
.

He
was
admitted
to
the
neurology
ICU
for
closer
monitoring
and
was
stable
overnight
-
BP
was
initially
elevated
and
required
a
labetalol
drip
for
<
24
hours
,
then
stabilized
.

The
goal
SBP
of
<
150
was
achieved
.

Coags
and
UA
were
checked
and
were
normal
.

For
the
question
of
seizure
activity
associated
with
a
cortical
bleed
,
he
was
started
prophylactically
on
Keppra
(
given
questionable
allergy
to
dilantin
)
,
at
500
mg
bid
;
no
seizure
activity
was
seen
.

This
medication
should
be
continued
as
an
outpatient
at
least
while
the
bleed
has
time
to
clear
up
,
with
planned
titration
up
to
1000
mg
bid
on
04-05
.

Head
CT
repeated
on
03-30
was
unchanged
,
and
the
patient
remained
stable
with
only
very
suble
focal
exam
findings
(
very
mild
right
pronator
drift
)
as
well
as
his
persistently
poor
memory
related
to
dementia
.

The
plan
after
24
hours
was
to
transfer
him
to
the
floor
,
but
the
hospital
was
full
and
he
never
got
a
bed
.

Cardiovascularly
,
lipitor
and
amiodarone
were
continued
.

He
could
not
get
an
MRI
due
to
his
pacemaker
.

There
were
no
telemetry
events
,
and
he
ruled
out
by
enzyme
.

Pulmonlologically
,
his
chest
xray
was
negative
and
he
complained
of
no
breathing
problems
.

Endocrinologically
,
BG
was
monitored
to
improve
outcome
in
ICU
setting
though
he
had
no
history
of
DM
.

Of
note
,
Hba1c
done
03-04
was
slightly
elevated
(
"
borderline
DM
"
)
at
6.3
;
this
was
repeated
and
was
still
pending
on
the
day
of
discharge
.

Ins
/
outs
and
electrolytes
were
monitored
and
were
not
abnormal
;
he
was
on
a
bowel
regimen
,
VD
boots
and
PUD
prophylaxis
with
protonix
during
the
admission
.

Walking
was
assessed
later
and
the
patient
was
unstable
on
his
feet
.

PT
was
asked
to
see
him
for
this
gait
problem
.

Brandon
felt
well
and
was
seen
by
PT
who
suggested
a
rehab/Hahnemann
Hospital
(
Worcester
)
to
work
on
walking
with
the
eventual
goal
of
returning
to
assisted
living
with
his
wife
when
walking
improved
.

Follow-up
was
arranged
with
neurosurgery
in
5-6
weeks
with
repeat
head
ct
to
be
arranged
by
neurosurgery
office
to
make
sure
blood
has
cleared
,
and
if
indicated
,
to
look
for
a
possible
underlying
lesion
(
although
unlikely
)
.

LABORATORY
DATA
:

Coagulation
profile
notable
for
a
PT
18
,
PTT
36.7
and
an
INR
of
2.4
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
and
begun
on
cefotetan
and
Flagyl
,
as
well
as
heparin
.

Her
INR
dropped
to
1.6
prior
to
surgery
,
and
her
PTT
was
in
the
mid
80s
prior
to
surgery
.

She
was
admitted
and
placed
on
a
bowel
prep
two
days
before
surgery
and
was
taken
to
the
Operating
Room
on
hospital
day
#
3
,
10/28/97
.

At
that
time
,
she
underwent
sigmoid
colectomy
and
ventral
hernia
repair
.
(
A
full
account
of
this
operation
can
be
found
in
the
Operative
Note
)
.

She
tolerated
this
procedure
without
complications
initially
and
was
taken
to
the
Recovery
Room
in
stable
condition
.

Postoperatively
,
she
had
her
heparin
restarted
,
and
had
a
PTT
rising
to
142.8
and
then
down
to
92
.

Her
primary
postoperative
development
was
the
passage
of
some
blood
clots
and
blood
per
rectum
on
postoperative
day
#
2
.

She
continued
to
pass
blood
per
rectum
and
was
transfused
with
one
unit
of
packed
red
blood
cells
.

Her
preoperative
hematocrit
was
41
and
her
hematocrit
dropped
to
30.4
on
postoperative
day
#
2
.

This
was
a
drop
from
an
immediate
postoperative
hematocrit
of
35.4
.

Upon
receiving
the
one
unit
of
red
blood
cells
,
her
hematocrit
returned
to
33
,
and
in
the
two
days
subsequent
to
the
transfusion
,
returned
to
34
.

Otherwise
,
her
postoperative
course
was
uneventful
with
gradual
resolution
of
the
passage
of
blood
per
rectum
.

Her
heparin
was
discontinued
when
it
was
noted
that
she
was
bleeding
per
rectum
and
her
PTT
drifted
to
a
normal
range
of
35
by
postoperative
day
#
3
.

On
postoperative
day
#
1
,
the
patient
was
restarted
on
2
mg
of
Coumadin
.

However
,
due
to
the
episode
of
bleeding
on
postoperative
day
#
2
,
the
Coumadin
was
held
for
two
consecutive
days
,
and
then
restarted
on
postoperative
day
#
4
.

At
this
time
,
she
is
given
3
mg
and
was
gradually
increased
to
her
regular
regimen
of
4
mg
alternating
with
3
mg.

The
patient
&apos;s
INR
had
dropped
to
1.7
at
the
time
of
operation
,
and
remained
in
this
range
initially
,
but
began
to
rise
to
2.0
with
her
Coumadin
dosing
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
it
was
1.9
,
for
which
she
received
4
mg.

On
the
next
day
,
it
was
1.6
and
she
returned
to
a
normal
dosing
of
4
mg
followed
by
outpatient
draws
to
determine
the
further
Coumadin
dosing
.

This
was
postoperative
day
#
6
,
at
which
time
she
is
ready
for
discharge
.

The
rest
of
her
hospital
course
was
unremarkable
,
with
perioperative
ampicillin
,
gentamicin
and
Flagyl
discontinued
on
postoperative
day
#
1
.

She
had
some
initial
nausea
but
had
no
emesis
.

Her
nasogastric
tube
was
discontinued
on
postoperative
day
#
1
,
and
she
tolerated
a
regular
diet
by
postoperative
day
#
3
.

She
had
flatus
and
regular
bowel
movements
by
postoperative
day
#
5
.

She
also
complained
of
some
slight
dizziness
upon
getting
up
.

For
this
reason
,
her
normal
Lopressor
and
Norvasc
were
held
.

It
was
felt
that
this
was
re-equalibration
after
being
sedentary
and
mostly
in
bed
following
the
operation
.

She
had
some
slight
headaches
which
resolved
with
Tylenol
,
and
the
dizziness
resolved
as
well
.

She
was
ready
for
discharge
on
postoperative
day
#
6
.

Her
wound
remained
benign
and
was
healing
nicely
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Assessment
:

68M
with
multiple
vascular
risk
factors
presents
with
acute
onset
right-sided
hemiparesis
and
dysarthria
,
aphasia
concerning
for
acute
left
MCA
infarct
.

Patient
arrived
in
Daniel
within
3
hours
of
symptom
onset
and
head
CT
showed
no
evidence
of
bleed
.

However
,
as
wife
had
not
seen
patient
before
he
became
symptomatic
,
there
was
some
concern
that
he
had
symptoms
earlier
than
6
am
,
and
therefore
would
be
outside
the
3
hour
window
for
TPA
.

MRI
was
performed
which
showed
diffusion
abnormalities
but
no
hyperintensity
on
T2
/
FLAIR
imaging
supporting
the
acute
onset
.

Therefore
,
IV
tpa
thrombolytics
were
administered
within
3
hours
of
symptom
onset
.

Within
minutes
the
patient
showed
decreased
right
sided
weakness
and
improved
from
a
global
aphasia
to
an
anterior
aphasia
picture
.

Given
the
likely
embolic
etiology
of
infarct
,
carotid
doppler
and
TTE
were
performed
.

Doppler
revealed
no
hemodynamically
significant
lesions
bilaterally
.

Echo
did
not
reveal
potential
source
of
emboli
,
but
showed
striking
left
ventricle
akinesis
and
hypokinesis
presumbly
due
to
past
MI
x
2
.

Given
that
the
stroke
occurred
while
taking
aspirin
and
plavix
,
and
given
the
severe
akinesis
of
the
left
ventricle
,
we
decided
to
initiate
anticoagulation
with
warfarin
to
help
prevent
future
strokes
.

Anticoagulation
therapy
was
initiated
with
heparin
and
coumadin
beginning
on
the
evening
of
2016-08-23
.

The
patient
and
his
wife
,
a
nurse
,
were
educated
on
low
molecular
wt
heparin
,
which
was
started
in
the
hospital
on
2015-08-26
with
close
follow-up
scheduled
with
Dr.
Demmert
of
the
Wareham
VA
primary
care
clinic
the
next
morning
.

His
depakote
was
continued
for
his
bipolar
disorder

nearly
intact
in
the
limbs
,
though
he
still
had
a
right-sided
facial
droop
.

Additionally
,
he
still
had
mild
dysarthria
and
mild
anterior
aphasia
.

Additionally
,
risk
factor
modification
was
continued
.

Lipid
panel
was
checked
and
showed
good
control
of
lipids
on
his
home
dose
of
zocor
.

Patient
has
no
history
of
diabetes
,
and
fasting
glucose
was
78
,
but
A1C
was
slightly
elevated
at
5.9
.

He
may
need
further
glucose
monitoring
in
the
future
.

His
home
hypertensive
medications
were
held
while
in
the
hospital
to
help
increase
cerebral
perfusion
and
prevent
further
ischemia
.

They
will
be
restarted
on
discharge
.

Speech
therapy
was
also
consulted
,
and
recommended
oupatient
speech
therapy
.

Similarly
,
outpatient
PT
was
recommended
for
his
gait
difficulties
from
his
previous
strokes
.

Residual
deficits
include
right
side
facial
droop
from
previous
stroke
and
moderately
severe
dysarthria
and
anterior
aphasia
with

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
63
year
old
woman
with
a
history
of
mixed
adenocarcinoma
and
large
cell
carcinoma
of
the
left
upper
lobe
of
the
lung
who
is
being
admitted
for
Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy
with
Cisplatinum
,
5-FU
and
Velban
.

Her
history
has
been
well
documented
in
her
previous
notes
.

Briefly
,
she
was
originally
diagnosed
in
April
1993
with
lung
carcinoma
.

Bronchoscopy
and
mediastinoscopy
revealed
an
unresectable
mediastinal
tumor
with
the
left
tracheobronchial
angle
node
positive
for
cancer
,
and
the
right
paratracheal
node
positive
for
anthracosis
.

Formal
pathology
revealed
a
poorly
differentiated
adenocarcinoma
with
focal
giant
cells
.

Bone
scan
,
head
CT
and
other
staging
studies
were
all
negative
for
evidence
of
metastatic
disease
.

The
patient
is
being
treated
with
preoperative
neoadjuvant
chemotherapy
using
5
FU
,
Vinblastine
,
Cisplatinum
and
concomitant
radiation
therapy
.

She
is
now
admitted

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

This
is
a
39
year-old
female
with
diabetes
type
I
,
hypothyroidism
,
gastroparesis
who
was
transfered
for
hypoxic
respiratory
failure
.

1.
Hypoxic
Rspiratory
Failure
:

She
arrived
intubated
and
sedated
from
Esteban
Hospital
.

On
arrival
a
chest
x-ray
showed
perihilar
and
bibasilar
opacities
,
which
appeared
conistent
with
pulmonary
edema
but
also
possibly
consistent
with
a
pneumonia
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
ARDS
.

She
was
known
to
have
gram-positive
cocci
in
her
sputum
at
the
outside
hospital
.

A
bronchoscopy
with
BAL
was
performed
and
a
sputum
sample
eventually
grew
out
MRSA
.

She
was
treated
with
vancomycin
to
cover
her
MRSA
pneumonia
.

A
CT
scan
was
performed
on
07-17
to
evaluate
the
soft
tissue
swelling
seen
on
CT
at
the
outside
hospital
.

The
CT
showed
increased
soft
tissues
within
the
pharynx
which
was
felt
to
be
secondary
to
prolonged
intubation
/
trauma
.

She
was
treated
with
steroids
for
this
swelling
at
the
outside
hospital
,
and
these
were
continued
.

It
was
decided
that
patient
should
receive
one
more
trial
off
the
vent
before
committing
her
to
a
tracheotomy
.

She
did
well
on
minimal
vent
settings
but
it
was
decided
to
delay
extubating
the
patient
until
the
morning
of
6/2
.

Overnight
,
the
patient
became
hypoxic
,
dropping
to
the
80
's
.

A
chest
x-ray
showed
that
the
ET
tube
was
displaced
to
very
high
in
the
trachea
.

The
cuff
was
deflated
and
the
patient
was
extubated
.

She
was
placed
in
supplemental
oxygen
by
shovel
mask
and
her
sats
immediately
improved
.

She
was
weaned
down
until
she
was
maintaining
her
oxygen
saturation
above
90%
on
6L
by
nasal
cannuala
.

As
she
was
doing
well
without
evidence
of
stridor
,
the
steroids
were
stopped
.

She
did
well
and
was
weaned
from
supplemental
oxygen
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
she
was
oxygenating
well
on
room
air
.

She
Will
need
to
complete
a
14
day
course
of
vancomycin
for
her
MRSA
pneumonia
on
2019-07-30
.

2.
Enterobacter
bacteremia
:

She
was
initially
covered
broadly
with
vancomycin
,
ciprofloxacin
,
and
falgyl
.

She
had
positive
blood
cultures
at
Mediplex
Rehab
Hospital
Hospital
for
gram
negative
rods
.

Subsequently
,
zosyn
was
added
.

The
cultures
grew
out
enterobacter
cloacae
.

It
was
unclear
the
source
of
her
bacteremia
.

Her
stool
cultures
were
negative
.

Her
central
line
was
removed
and
the
tip
was
culture
negative
.

She
was
transitioned
to
on
levofloxacin
for
her
bacteremia
.

She
had
no
positive
cultures
during
this
admission
.

Once
she
was
more
stable
,
an
abdominal
CT
was
performed
to
look
for
an
abscess
.

This
study
was
negative
.

However
,
the
study
was
limited
due
to
inadequate
po
contrast
intake
by
the
patient
;
it
did
show
a
question
of
a
cecal
cystic
lesion
verse
normal
loop
of
bowel
.

This
study
will
need
to
be
repeated
once
she
is
tolerating
po
's
.

She
will
complete
a
14
day
course
of
levofloxacin
for
her
bacteremia
on
2019-07-30
.

She
was
intially
maintained
on
an
insulin
drip
for
tight
glycemic
control
.

She
was
followed
by
Albano
during
the
admission
.

She
was
initially
maintained
on
D5W
,
which
was
increased
to
D10W
as
the
patient
was
persistently
borderline
hypoglycemic
while
on
insulin
drip
.

Once
she
began
to
take
PO
's
,
the
insulin
drip
was
stopped
and
patient
was
started
on
glargine
with
a
humalog
sliding
scale
.

While
her
po
intake
was
minimal
she
was
maintained
on
supplemental
IV
dextrose
to
suppress
ketosis
.

While
she
was
on
the
IV
dextrose
,
she
required
up
to
26
units
of
glargine
for
glycemic
control
.

As
she
starting
taking
some
foods
,
her
glargine
was
decrease
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
her
glargine
was
10
.

Her
blood
glucose
were
under
good
control
.

The
day
prior
to
discharge
,
she
was
nauseated
and
not
taking
pos
.

Therefore
,
she
received
1L
of
D5
,
and
her
sugars
were
elevated
to
400
the
day
of
discharge
.

4.
Gastroparesis
:

She
has
a
history
of
gastroparesis
secondary
to
long-standing
type
I
diabetes
.

Once
she
was
extubated
,
she
was
nauseated
with
emesis
.

She
was
intially
treated
with
erythromycin
for
pro-motility
as
she
had
a
bad
reaction
to
reglan
in
the
past
.

She
continued
to
remained
nauseated
so
she
was
treated
with
phenergan
,
anzemet
,
zofran
,
and
ativan
.

She
intermittently
was
able
tolerate
pos
.

Her
nausea
was
accompanied
by
abdominal
pain
for
which
she
was
treated
with
morphine
.

She
was
transitioned
to
a
PCA
for
better
pain
control
.

She
continued
to
have
nausea
despite
an
agressive
anti-emetic
regimen
.

It
was
felt
that
her
symptoms
were
secondary
to
gastroparesis
.

However
,
other
causes
were
looked
for
including
adrenal
insufficiency
and
bowel
obstruction
.

She
had
a
normal
cortisol
stimulation
test
.

A
abdominal
plain
film
showed
non-specific
bowel
gas
patterns
that
may
represent
an
early
obstruction
.

A
NG
tube
was
placed
for
decompression
given
the
signs
of
early
obstruction
the
day
of
transfer
.

The
GI
service
was
consulted
and
they
felt
that
her
symptoms
were
all
gastroparesis
.

They
recommended
erythromycin
and
zelnorm
.

She
should
eventually
have
a
tissue
transglutaminase
to
rule
out
celiac
disease
.

5.
Transaminitis
:

Per
report
,
She
had
elevated
LFTs
at
the
outside
hospital
.

A
right
upper
quadrant
ultrasound
was
performed
and
was
negative
for
any
acute
pathology
.

Her
LFTs
trended
down
during
this
admission
.

6.
Hypothyroidism
:

She
was
maintained
on
her
levothyroxine
.

While
she
was
not
taking
adequate
pos
,
she
was
on
IV
levothyroxine
.

7.
F/E/N
:

She
was
NPO
while
intubated
and
recived
tube
feedings
for
nutrition
.

After
extubation
,
patient
was
started
on
sips
and
had
a
speech
and
swallow
evaluation
.

She
was
cleared
to
advance
her
diet
as
tolerated
.

She
only
tolerated
some
clear
liquids
.

At
the
time
of
transfer
,
she
was
NPO
given
her
NG
tube
.

8.
Prophylaxis
:

PPI
,
Heparin
SQ
.

9.
Access
:

Her
central
line
was
removed
given
the
concern
for
a
line
infection
.

She
had
a
double
lumen
PICC
place
.

INTERPRETATION
:

Findings
:

This
study
was
compared
to
the
prior
study
of
2017-06-01
.

LEFT
ATRIUM
:

Normal
LA
size
.

LEFT
VENTRICLE
:

Wall
thickness
and
cavity
dimensions
were
obtained
from
2D
images
.

Normal
LV
wall
thicknesses
and
cavity
size
.

Suboptimal
technical
quality
,
a
focal
LV
wall
motion
abnormality
cannot
be
fully
excluded
.

No
resting
LVOT
gradient
.

RIGHT
VENTRICLE
:

Normal
RV

.

AORTA
:

Normal
aortic

.

AORTIC
VALVE
:

Normal

.

MITRAL
VALVE
:

Normal

)
MR
.

TRICUSPID
VALVE
:

Mild

hypertension
.

PERICARDIUM
:

No
pericardial
effusion
.

GENERAL
COMMENTS
:

Suboptimal
image
quality
-
poor
echo
windows
.

Based
on
1997
AHA
endocarditis
prophylaxis
recommendations
,
the
echo
findings
indicate
a
low
risk
(
prophylaxis
not
recommended
).

Clinical
decisions
regarding
the
need
for
prophylaxis
should
be
based
on
clinical
and
echocardiographic
data
.

Conclusions
:

The
left
atrium
is
normal
in
size
.

Left
ventricular
wall
thicknesses
and
cavity
size
are
normal
.

Due
to
suboptimal
technical
quality
,
a
focal
wall
motion
abnormality
cannot
be
fully
excluded
.

Overall
systolic
function
is
good
(
LVEF
>
40%
).

Right
ventricular
chamber
size
and
free
wall
motion
are
normal
.

The
aortic
valve
leaflets
appear
structurally
normal
with
good
leaflet
excursion
.

No
aortic
regurgitation
is
seen
.

The
mitral
valve
leaflets
are
structurally
normal
.

Mild
(
1+
)
mitral
regurgitation
is
seen
.

There
is
mild
pulmonary
artery
systolic
hypertension
.

There
is
no
pericardial
effusion
.

IMPRESSION
:

Good
global
biventricular
systolic
function
.

Mild
mitral
regurgitation
.

The
prior
study
of
2017-06-01
(
tape
reviewed
)
was
of
very
suboptimal
technical
quality
and
not
directly
comparable
to
the
current
study
.

If
more
definitive
information
regarding
ventricualr
fuynction
is
needed
,
a
cardiac
MRI
(
(
951
)
247-0244
)
or
radionuclide
study
is
suggested
.

Based
on
1997
AHA
endocarditis
prophylaxis
recommendations
,
the
echo
findings
indicate
a
low
risk
(
prophylaxis
not
recommended
).

Clinical
decisions
regarding
the
need
for
prophylaxis
should
be
based
on
clinical
and
echocardiographic
data
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Mr.

Junk
was
a
34
year
old
gentleman
with
no
significant
past
medical
history
except
for
a
history
of
of
intravenous
drug
abuse
.

He
was
status
post
a
rehabilitation
hospitalization
at
the
Raya
Ma
Den
Erinmarg
Hospital
with
a
recent
recrudescence
of
his
drug
abuse
.

He
was
admitted
to
the
Sephsandpot
Center
on
the
morning
of
4/9
and
was
subsequently
transferred
to
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
for
further
care
.

The
patient
was
apparently
well
until
one
day
prior
to
admission
.

His
family
reports
that
he
had
worked
that
day
.

He
relates
using
large
doses
of
Cocaine
and
Heroin
early
in
the
morning
on
the
day
of
admission
.

At
3:00
a.m.
on
the
day
of
admission
he
was
found
by

medical
technicians
&quot;
crawling
on
all
fours
&quot;
,
confused
,
and
combative
outside
his
home
.

He
gave
an
equivocal
history
of
fevers
and
chills
on
the
days
prior
to
admission
.

Bystanders
report
that
he
was
assaulted
about
20

was
taken
to
the

,
tachycardic
with
a
heart
rate
to
186
,
aneuric
,
hyperthermic
,
with
a
temperature
to
105
degrees

was
treated
with

received
two
amps
of
Narcan
.

He
received
one
gram
of
Ceftriaxone
intravenously
after
blood
cultures
were
drawn
.

His
initial
arterial
blood
gas
at
the
Sephsandpot
Center
revealed
a
p02
of
76
,
pC02
14
,
and
a
pH
of
7.44
on
room
air
.

He
was
then
transferred
via

Flight
to
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
.

He
denied
any
history
of
recent
travel
.

Toxicology

Shortly
after

hospital
he
had
been
intubated
for
a
respiratory
rate
of
60
.

He
required
medical
paralysis
for
this
.

He
was

It
was
unclear
whether
this
was
due
to
superficial
tenderness
or
abdominal
tenderness
.

He

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
with
the
diagnosis
of
Cocaine
induced
rhabdomyolysis
,
renal
failure
,
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation
,
shock
,
hepatic
failure
,
pancreatitis
,
and
thrombocytopenia
in
the
setting
of
Cocaine
intoxication
.

He
was
accepted
at
the
Vo
Yd
Burgsygu
Hospital
Center
Intensive
Care
Unit
and
his
hospital
course
will
be
reviewed
by
problems
.

1-Rhabdomyolysis
.

The
patient
had
massive
Cocaine
induced
rhabdomyolysis
.

This
resulted
in
tremendous
third
spacing
of
fluid
and
persistent
intervascular
hypovolemia
.

The
patient
&apos;s
creatinine
______________
kinase
peaked
at
56,160
with
negative
MB
percentages
.

The
aldolase
was
positive
at
142
.

This
was
further
complicated
by
hypocalcemia
which
resulted
in
mild
electrocardiographic
abnormalities
.

The
patient
&apos;s
urine
was
alkalinized
with
intravenous
bicarbonate
to
maximize
the
myoglobin
secretion
.

The
patient
&apos;s
urine
output
was
further
augmented
by
adding
Dopamine
.

Nevertheless
,
the
patient
&apos;s
renal
failure
continued
to
progress
.

Over
the
course
of
the
hospitalization
his
CK
fell
in
the
serum
.

Much
of
his
diffuse
pain
was
felt
to
be
due
to
this
massive
rhabdomyolysis
.

2-Renal
failure
.

The
creatinine
was
4.4
on
admission
and
peaked
at
10.5
on
the
15th
.

The
urinalysis
revealed
4+
albumin
with
marked
occult
blood
.

Peritoneal
dialysis
was
instituted
on
4/11
after
a
Tenckhoff
catheter
was
placed
by
Drs.
Freierm
,
Le
,
and
Round
.

Subsequently
his
creatinine
rose
for
three
days
and
then
stabilized
at
10
.

He
continued
to
make
minimal
urine
throughout
the
hospitalization
.

3-Disseminated
intravascular
coagulation
.

On
admission
the
patient
&apos;s
prothrombin
time
was
27.7
with
a
partial
thromboplastin
time
of
greater
than
100
and
a
d-dimer
positive
at
8
with
a
fibrinogen
of
69
.

He
went
on
to
develop
profound
thrombocytopenia
complicated
by
hemorrhage
.

The
patient
was
supported
with
abundant
use
of
fresh
frozen
plasma
,
cryoprecipitate
,
platelets
,
and
packed
red
blood
cells
.

His
DIC
was
further
complicated
by
hepatic
failure
which
resulted
in
poor
endogenous
production
of
clotting
factors
and
he
remained
fresh
frozen
plasma
dependent
.

4-Septic
shock
.

The
patient
remained
pressor
dependent
throughout
his
hospitalization
.

He
was
maintained
variously
on
Levophed
,
Dobutamine
,
Dopamine
,
and
ultimately
Epinephrine
for
blood
pressure
support
.

Hemodynamic
monitoring
revealed
low
systemic
vascular
resistance
and
high
cardiac
output
.

He
had
multiple
sources
of
infection
including
his
sinuses
,
lungs
,
and
multiple
lines
.

This
will
be
discussed
below
.

Further
he
had
massive
muscle
necrosis
and
hepatic
failure
.

An
echocardiogram
on
4/12
revealed
a
dilated
left
ventricle
which
was
diffusely
mildly
hypokinetic
with
no
vegetations
.

His
ejection
fraction
was
55%
.

On
4/16
the
pulmonary
artery
catheter
was
placed
which
revealed
a
wedge
pressure
of
8
,
cardiac
index
of
4.5
,
and
an
SVR
of
5.8
.

5-Hepatic
failure
.

His
SGPT
on
admission
was
2,520
with
a
peak
at
7,680
on
hospital
day
two
.

He
had
complete
loss
of
synthetic
and
conjugation
function
of
the
liver
with
rising
bilirubin
and
falling
albumin
with
dependence
on
transfusion
for
support
of
his
prothrombin
time
.

He
was
seen
in
consultation
by
the
GI
Service
and
the
Liver
Transplantation
Service
.

Given
his
multiple
other
medical
problems
,
the
direness
of
his
situation
,
and
his
ongoing
substance
abuse
at
the
time
of
admission
he
was
deemed
not
to
be
a
candidate
for
a
liver
transplantation
.

6-Cocaine
intoxication
.

Serum
Cocaine
was
positive
6-12
hours
ingestion
at
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
.

Further
,
at
Ceanotsit
Ortgold
Center
his
serum
toxicology
screens
were
positive
.

This
is
thought
to
be
the
insighting
cause
of
his
massive
rhabdomyolysis
and
hepatic
failure
.

7-Pneumonia
.

The
patient
developed
two
pneumonias
with
two
separate
organisms
.

The
first
was
Acinetobacter
calcoaceticus
subspecies
anitratus
,
treated
with
Ciprofloxacin
and
Gentamicin
.

He
subsequently
developed
a
staphylococcus
aureus
pneumonia
which
was
treated
with
Vancomycin
,
dosed
to
levels
appropriate
for
his
renal
failure
.

He
was
seen
in
consultation
by
the
Infectious
Disease
Service
who
advised
us
on
antibiotic
choices
daily
.

8-Pancreatitis
.

The
amylase
on
admission
was
279
with
a
lipase
of
161
.

Although
not
fully
this
may
have
contributed
to
his
hypocalcemia
and
volume
requirements
.

9-Catheter
tip
infections
.

The
patient
grew
out
coagulase
negative
staphylococcus
from
the
femoral
lines
which
were
placed
during
his
profound
hypertension
.

These
were
treated
with
Vancomycin
.

10-Anemia
.

The
patient
&apos;s
hematocrit
was
33%
on
admission
and
fell
to
28
requiring
4
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
over
the
course
of
his
hospitalization
.

11-Coma
.

The
patient
,
although
initially
minimally
responsive
,
went
on
to
develop
a
deep
comatose
state
.

A
CT
scan
on
admission
revealed
no
evidence
of
hemorrhage
though
he
did
have
sphenoid
sinusitis
.

The
lumbar
puncture
and
sinus
exploration
were
unable
to
be
performed
given
the
patient
&apos;s
persistent
coagulopathy
.

The
patient
was
treated
empirically
with
Nafcillin
and
Ceftriaxone
for
meningitis
and
sinusitis
.

Further
complicating
this
was
his
profound
liver
failure
with
rising
ammonias
and
hepatic
encephalopathy
.

Despite
maximal
supports
the
patient
continued
to
be
hypotensive
.

Mid-way
through
his
hospital
course
he
developed
trilobar
pneumonia
and
this
was
probably
complicated
further
by
adult
respiratory
distress
syndrome
and
the
multi-organ
system
failure
syndrome
.

The
patient
remained
mechanically
ventilated
throughout
his
hospitalization
.

Nevertheless
,
he
developed
refractory
hypoxemia
,
hypotension
,
and
ultimately
the
patient
died
despite
total
life
support
.

.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
transferred
for
cardiac
catheterization
.

Emergent
cardiac
catheterization
revealed
an
ejection
fraction
of
45%
,
right
dominant
coronary
artery
system
with
occlusive
single
vessel
disease
of
the
LAD
.

Multiple
wires
were
used
to
attempt
to
cross
the
total
occlusion
,
but
were
ultimately
unsuccessful
.

The
patient
was
continued
on
a
heparin
drip
for
atrial
fibrillation
.

Cardiothoracic
Surgery
consultation
was
obtained
and
the
patient
was
taken
to
the
Operating
Room
on
2010-03-12
for
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
times
two
;
LIMA
to
the
LAD
,
saphenous
vein
graft
to
the
diagonal
artery
.

Subsequent
to
this
,
the
patient
was
transferred
to
the
CRSU
for
closer
monitoring
.

He
was
deemed
to
be
too
lethargic
and
sleepy
to
be
extubated
on
postoperative
day
number
zero
.

The
patient
was
extubated
early
on
postoperative
day
number
one
without
significant
complication
.

He
remained
in
atrial
fibrillation
.

The
EP
Service
was
consulted
regarding
the
patient
's
atrial
fibrillation
.

This
was
his
main
issue
in
the
postoperative
course
.

He
was
attempted
on
multiple
different
drugs
including
Procainamide
,
Diltiazem
,
Esmolol
,
Sotalol
,
Amiodarone
.

The
patient
was
kept
therapeutically
anticoagulated
throughout
this
period
.

The
patient
was
also
started
on
digoxin
.

Ultimately
,
the
patient
was
transferred
to
the
floor
and
anticoagulation
with
Coumadin
was
begun
.

The
patient
arrived
on
the
floor
with
medications
as
follows
:

Sotalol
180
mg
b.i.d.
,
Diltiazem
90
mg
q.i.d.
,
digoxin
0.125
mg
q.d.

While
the
patient
was
awaiting
therapeutic
anticoagulation
with
Coumadin
,
he
spontaneously
converted
into
normal
sinus
rhythm
.

The
patient
was
found
to
have
a
resting
heart
rate
of
approximately
50
subsequent
to
this
.

In
consultation
with
the
EP
Service
,
Diltiazem
was
stopped
.

After
approximately
24
hours
,
the
patient
converted
back
into
atrial
fibrillation
and
Diltiazem
was
restarted
at
60
mg
q.i.d.

The
patient
then
had
one
more
episode
where
he
was
converted
to
normal
sinus
rhythm
but
this
lasted
only
a
few
hours
before
reverting
back
to
atrial
fibrillation
.

The
patient
was
ultimately
discharged
on
postoperative
day
number
16
,
tolerating
a
regular
diet
,
and
adequate
pain
control
on
p.o.
pain
medications
,
having
no
anginal
symptoms
and
with
an
INR
of
2.0
.

The
patient
failed
multiple
attempts
at
cardioversion
.

on
the
day
after
the
event
and
was
transferred
to
the

his
hand
circumferentially
and
on
his
forearm
.

Pulses
were
intact
.

No
evidence
of
compartment
syndrome
.

Evaluation
in
the
emergency
room
revealed
the
patient
to
be
stable
and
he
was
evaluated
by
ophthalmology
who
also
felt
that
the
patient
had
no
injury
to
his
eyes
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
taken
from
the
emergency
room
and
transferred
to
the
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
airway
observation
.

He
was
given
three
liters
of
IV
hydration
with
good
urine
output
response
.

His
wounds
were
dressed
with
antiointment
and
Xeroform
with
the
plan
to
take
him
to
the
operating
room
for
debridement
under
general
anesthesia
and
application
of
artificial
skin
.

The
patient
remained
hemodynamically
stable
with
good
urine
output
.

While
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
the
patient
was
put
on
delirium
tremons
prophylaxis
with
Serax
around
the
clock
.

There
was
no
evidence
while
in
the
hospital
.

The
patient
was
taken
to
the
operating
room
on
1/5/97
.

At
that
time
the
patient
underwent
debridement
of
his
facial
wounds
and
debridement
of
his
right
hand
and
forearm
with
application
of
artificial
skin
which
is
the
dermagraft
TC
.

The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
well
.

There
were
no
complications
.

Postoperatively
the
patient
was
transferred
out
of
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
to
the
burn
floor
where
he
received
dressing
changes
p.r.n.

The
patient
remained
afebrile
and
other
vital
signs
were
within
normal
limits
.

On
the
day
of
discharge
the
patient
&apos;s
dressing
was
taken
down
completely
and
evaluation
of
the
derma
graft
was
made
.

At
that
time
it
appeared
well
adhered
to
the
underlying
skin
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
infection
.

The
patient
was
screened
by
the
rehabilitation
facility
and
felt
to
be
an
acceptable
candidate
.

The
patient
and
his
family
agreed
to
transfer
from

Valley
Hospital
to

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Mrs.
Mandelbaum
was
admitted
and
underwent
three
vessel
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
by
Dr.
Larry
Mckinney
.

Of
note
,
intraoperative
transesophageal
echocardiogram
evaluation
showed
only
mild
mitral
regurgitation
,
so
no
repair/replacement
was
indicated
.

Following
the
operation
,
she
was
brought
to
the
CSRU
.

On
postoperative
day
one
,
she
was
noted
to
be
largely
unresponsive
with
left
hemiparesis
.

Restlessness
with
body
tremors
were
also
noted
.

A
stat
MRI
was
notable
for
multiple
abnormal
foci
consistent
with
systemic
emboli
.

These
were
found
in
the
right
cerebellar
,
occipital
and
anterior
parietal
lobes
.

The
neurology
service
was
consulted
and
attributed
these
findings
to
cholesterol
emboli
.

Due
to
seizure
activity
,
Dilantin
was
started
.

Anticoagulation
was
not
recommended
.

Over
the
next
several
days
,
her
neurological
status
slowly
improved
.

She
was
eventually
extubated
without
incident
.

She
went
on
to
experience
paroxysmal
atrial
fibrillation
which
was
initially
treated
with
intravenous
Amiodarone
.

She
concomitantly
had
loose
stools
which
were
C.
diff
negative
.

Her
clinical
status
stablized
and
she
transferred
to
the
step
down
unit
on
postoperative
day
six
.

She
remained
mostly
in
a
normal
sinus
rhythm
and
transitioned
to
oral
Amiodarone
which
will
need
to
continue
for
three
months
postop
.

She
tolerated
beta
blockade
which
was
slowly
advanced
as
tolerated
.

She
worked
daily
with
physical
and
occupational
therapy
.

Her
neurological
status
continued
to
improve
.

Acyclovir
was
eventually
increased
from
her
maintenance
dose
for
a
herpes
zoster
breakout
on
her
right
upper
back
.

In
addition
,
she
was
empirically
started
on
Flagyl
for
persistent
diarrhea
(
despite
negative
C.
diff
cultures
)
,
however
she
developed
an
additional
rash
on
her
buttocks
after
the
first
dose
of
flagyl
,
so
the
flagyl
was
discontinued
.

She
developed
a
urinary
tract
infection
for
which
she
was
started
on
Bactrim
.

A
foley
catheter
was
inserted
given
her
mutiple
episodes
of
incontinence
that
were
adding
to
skin
irritation
.

On
insertion
she
was
found
to
be
retaining
1400
cc
of
urine
,
so
the
foley
catheter
was
left
in
.

She
continued
to
make
clinical
improvements
and
was
cleared
for
discharge
to
rehab
on
postoperative
day
10
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
AND
HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Mr.
Breath
was
a
32
year
old
previously
healthy
unbelted
driver
whose
car
was
hit
at
high
speed
by
a
vehicle
driven
by
an
intoxicated
driver
.

The
patient
was
ejected
and
his
vehicle
rolled
over
,
possibly
over
him
.

He
was
found
awake
at
the
scene
,
complaining
of
abdominal
pain
.

He
had
a
blood
pressure
of
60
systolic
upon
arrival
of
the
Giles
Min
General
Hospital
crew
.

Intravenous
fluids
was
given
.

He
was
paralyzed
and
endotracheally
intubated
,
and
a
14
gauge
catheter
was
inserted
in
his
left
chest
because
of
poor
breath
sounds
.

He
arrived
at
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
at
02:30
with
a
blood
pressure
of
86
and
a
heart
rate
of
170
.

Large
bore
cannulas
were
inserted
into
the
femoral
veins
,
bilateral
chest
tubes
were
placed
,
and
his
blood
pressure
rose
to
110
systolic
after
two
liters
of
crystalloid
.

He
had
an
ecchymosis
over
the
medial
right
costal
margin
and
his
abdomen
was
distended
.

His
hematocrit
was
36
,
and
creatinine
1.6
.

The
abdominal
tap
was
grossly
positive
for
blood
.

His
blood
pressure
fell
to
60
systolic
as
he
was
being
transferred
to
the
computerized
tomography
scan
table
;
the
scan
was
aborted
and
he
was
taken
directly
to
the
operating
room
at
03:00
.

At
laparotomy
,
there
was
a
liter
of
blood
in
the
peritoneal
cavity
.

There
was
a
class
II
laceration
of
the
left
liver
at
the
falciform
ligament
which
was
actively
bleeding
,
a
tear
of
the
transverse
mesocolon
from
its
base
to
the
bowel
wall
with
active
bleeding
,
a
7
cm
serosal
tear
of
the
adjacent
transverse
colon
,
and
a
large
central
retroperitoneal
hematoma
.

Control
of
the
super-celiac
aorta
was
obtained
,
and
both
left
and
right
sided
&quot;
Mattox
&quot;
maneuvers
were
performed
.

The
retroperitoneum
was
opened
,
with
vigorous
bleeding
resulting
.

This
was
controlled
,
necessitating
ten
minutes
of
aortic
clamping
and
found
to
have
originated
from
the
rupture
of
the
left
renal
vein
one
centimeter
from
its
junction
with
the
inferior
vena
cava
.

The
vein
was
divided
and
suture
ligated
.

Bleeding
from
the
liver
was
controlled
with
sutures
.

The
tears
in
the
transverse
mesocolon
and
colon
serosa
were
repaired
.

The
examination
of
the
remainder
of
the
abdominal
contents
revealed
no
other
injury
;
in
particular
,
the
entire
anterior
surface
and
the
immediately
juxtaduodenal
posterior
surface
of
the
pancreas
were
normal
.

The
patient
was
now
very
stable
,
and
he
was
taken
to
the
Respiratory
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

The
patient
had
received
ten
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
,
five
units
of
fresh
frozen
plasma
,
seven
units
of
platelets
,
and
nine
liters
of
Ringer
&apos;s
lactate
.

An
intracranial
pressure
monitoring
bolt
had
been
placed
by
the
Neurosurgery
Service
staff
during
the
laparotomy
.

Intracranial
pressures
were
normal
.

That
day
,
cranial
computerized
tomography
scan
and
cervical
spine
films
were
normal
.

An
arch
aortogram
was
normal
.

Over
the
ensuing
twenty-four
hours
,
bilateral
infiltrates
on
chest
X-ray
with
poor
oxygenation
and
labile
blood
pressure
requiring
PA
line
guided
fluid
and
pressors
developed
.

The
patient
had
a
large
fluid
requirement
with
total
body
capillary
leak
,
decreasing
SVR
,
oliguria
unresponsive
to
Lasix
/
Mannitol
accompanied
by
a
rise
in
creatinine
to
3.2
,
worsening
ARDS
,
a
rise
in
temperature
to
103
,
and
a
serum
amylase
of
1265
.

He
was
returned
to
the
operating
room
on
July
4
.

Three
liters
of
clear
green
fluid
were
found
in
the
abdominal
cavity
.

Exploration
of
the
pancreas
revealed
a
posterior
fracture
a
the
superior
mesenteric
vessels
.

Because
of
the
intense
diffuse
inflammatory
reaction
that
had
already
set
in
,
it
was
decided
that
neither
distal
pancreatic
resection
nor
Roux-en-Y
drainage
was
feasible
.

Four
large
flat
Jackson-Pratt
drains
were
placed
,
and
gastrostomy
,
jejunostomy
,
and
cholecystostomy
tubes
,
as
well
as
a
right
subclavian
Quinton
catheter
were
placed
.

The
patient
&apos;s
hemodynamics
had
improved
markedly
with
the
evacuation
of
the
peritoneal
pancreatic
fluid
,
so
that
he
was
no
longer
on
pressors
.

However
,
upon
transfer
from
the
operating
room
table
to
the
RICU
bed
,
he
suffered
a
cardiac
arrest
,
which
upon
investigation
was
a
primary
respiratory
arrest
;
the
initial
arterial
blood
gas
was
32/88/6.92
.

He
was
successfully
resuscitated
after
fifteen
minutes
of
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
and
he
was
taken
to
the
RICU
.

Continuous
venovenous
hemodialysis
was
started
on
July
5
,
and
continued
for
most
of
the
remainder
of
the
patient
&apos;s
course
.

Vancomycin
,
Flagyl
,
and
Aztreonam
were
given
for
gram
negative
Coccobacilli
(
later
identified
as
Bacteroides
)
that
had
grown
in
his
blood
cultures
and
gram
negative
rods
(
Enterobacter
)
in
his
peritoneal
fluid
.

He
was
kept
sedated
and
paralyzed
because
of
his
severe
adult
respiratory
distress
syndrome
.

Total
parenteral
nutrition
was
started
on
July
5
.

Initial
improvement
was
followed
by
recurrence
of
low
SVR
,
high
cardiac
output
,
ongoing
acidosis
,
requiring
norepinephrine
infusion
in
the
30
to
40
mcg
per
minute
range
;
drainage
from
the
Jackson-Pratt
drains
were
minimal
despite
irrigation
and
manipulation
.

The
patient
was
returned
to
the
operating
room
on
July
10
,
where
several
loculated
thin
fluid
collections
were
drained
and
obviously
necrotic
tissue
was
debrided
.

It
was
decided
to
place
more
drains
and
pack
the
lesser
sac
with
Adaptic
and
laparotomy
pads
.

The
abdomen
was
left
open
,
with
the
wound
margins
connected
by
a
sheet
of
Marlex
mesh
to
prevent
evisceration
.

He
was
returned
to
the
operating
room
on
July
12
,
13
,
16
,
19
,
21
,
and
23
for
packing
change
,
irrigation
and
debridement
.

Tracheostomy
was
also
performed
on
July
17
.

There
was
severe
diffuse
peritonitis
with
intense
inflammation
,
infection
,
and
patchy
necrosis
of
peritoneal
surfaces
and
of
the
distal
pancreas
.

The
subsequent
overall
course
was
a
slow
downhill
one
,
with
ongoing
extreme
hyperdynamic
(
cardiac
output
12
to
15
liters
per
minute
)
and
catabolic
state
.

On
July
26
,
abdominal
irrigation
and
debridement
was
performed
in
the
RICU
;
this
was
repeated
daily
for
the
next
three
days
.

On
July
29
,
the
septic
state
with
low
SVR
and
acidosis
accelerated
beyond
the
control
of
maximal
support
.

His
blood
pressure
gradually
fell
,
and
he
died
early
on
July
30
,
1993
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Briefly
,
this
68
year
old
male
with
a
history
of
coronary
artery
disease
,
diabetes
mellitus
,
peripheral
vascular
disease
,
was
admitted
originally
to
the
Podiatry
Service
for
a
left
patellar
mid-foot
ulcer
.

He
underwent
angiogram
on
2013-08-28
,
to
evaluate
his
circulation
and
found
at
that
time
that
the
patient
had
a
poor
circulation
to
the
left
leg
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
Vascular
Surgery
Service
for
bilateral
iliac
stenting
at
that
time
.

The
patient
also
at
that
time
was
followed
by
Cardiology
and
for
preoperative
evaluation
had
a
stress
test
which
was
positive
and
he
became
diaphoretic
but
denied
any
chest
pain
.

Atropine
was
given
and
heart
rate
returned
to
the
70s
and
his
blood
pressure
returned
to
the
120s
over
80s
.

The
patient
denied
any
orthopnea
,
shortness
of
breath
,
chest
pain
,
paroxysmal
nocturnal
dyspnea
or
cough
.

He
had
occasional
leg
swelling

LABORATORY
:

On
admission
,
his
BUN
was
13
,
creatinine
1.7
,
hematocrit
43
and
the
cholesterol
was
208
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
is
admitted
to
this
hospital
through
the
Podiatry
Service
;
however
,
the
stress
test
showed
multi-vessel
disease
.

Podiatry
continued
to
follow
for
evaluation
of
his
left
foot
ulcer
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
he
was
having
acetic
acid
wet-to-dry
dressing
changes
,
0.25%
q.
day
.

Vascular
Surgery
was
following
at
the
same
time
and
decided
that
bilateral
iliac
stenting
would
be
the
most
optimum
treatment
currently
and
suggested
that
the
patient
should
be
worked
up
for
cardiac
disease
prior
to
re-vascularization
.

Medicine
was
also
consulted
at
that
time
for
high
blood
pressure
and
for
the
biceps
pain
.

While
having
angiography
,
he
had
a
transient
increase
in
his
blood
pressure
and
became
diaphoretic
and
thus
precipitated
the
evaluation
for
cardiac
disease
.

Cardiology
was
consulted
at
that
time
to
evaluate
his
heart
.

The
patient
was
managed
on
the
Medical
Service
for
his
drop
in
blood
pressure
and
cardiac
evaluation
.

He
was
also
followed
by
Podiatry
and
Vascular
Surgery
.

He
was
taken
to
the
Cardiac
Catheterization
Laboratory
which
showed
multi-vessel
disease
and
Cardiothoracic
Surgery
was
consulted
.

The
patient
was
taken
to
the
Operating
Room
on
2013-09-04
,
where
a
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
times
four
was
performed
,
left
internal
mammary
artery
to
left
anterior
descending
,
saphenous
vein
graft
to
diagonal
,
saphenous
vein
graft
to
obtuse
marginal
and
saphenous
vein
graft
to
PC
by
Dr.
Wright
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
CSRU
postoperatively
where
he
did
well
.

He
was
slowly
weaned
from
his
ventilator
and
was
able
to
be
extubated
.

The
patient
was
able
to
be
weaned
to
six
liters
nasal
cannula
after
extubation
,
however
,
it
was
noted
on
chest
x-ray
that
he
had
a
small
apical
pneumothorax
.

A
repeat
chest
x-ray
showed
resolution
of
that
pneumothorax
.

The
patient
was
continued
on
an
insulin
drip
for
his
diabetes
mellitus
but
continued
to
improve
.

His
chest
tube
was
in
place
for
a
high
chest
tube
output
.

His
Foley
catheter
was
removed
and
the
patient
was
transferred
to
the
Floor
.

Physical
Therapy
was
consulted
in
order
to
assess
the
patient
's
ambulation
and
mobility
,
however
,
with
his
foot
infection
and
associated
pain
,
it
was
difficult
to
assess
at
that
time
.

After
arriving
on
the
Floor
,
the
patient
had
an
episode
of
rapid
atrial
fibrillation
which
was
treated
with
amiodarone
and
Lopressor
.

The
patient
resolved
,
however
,
Lasix
was
also
given
due
to
some
pulmonary
edema
and
increasing
oxygen
need
.

The
patient
continued
to
have
episodes
of
rapid
atrial
fibrillation
while
on
the
Floor
,
which
required
continued
diuresis
as
well
as
intravenous
Lopressor
.

His
chest
tube
and
Foley
catheter
were
removed
on
postoperative
day
number
three
,
and
the
patient
had
aggressive
chest
Physical
Therapy
and
nebulizer
treatments
.

His
dressing
changes
for
his
foot
continued
per
the
Podiatry
Service
and
his
leg
ulcer
was
noted
to
be
slowly
healing
.

The
patient
had
multiple
episodes
of
rapid
atrial
fibrillation
which
again
required
intravenous
Lopressor
.

Amiodarone
boluses
were
given
and
the
patient
was
started
on
400
three
times
a
day
of
p.o.
amiodarone
,
aggressive
pulmonary
toilet
and
continued
diuresis
was
done
,
however
,
the
patient
continued
to
have
respiratory
difficulties
when
in
rapid
atrial
fibrillation
.

The
patient
was
evaluated
on
postoperative
day
number
five
and
it
was
decided
at
that
time
that
the
patient
should
be
transferred
back
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
respiratory
difficulties
.

He
was
transferred
back
to
the
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
where
he
was
aggressively
diuresed
as
well
as
his
rate
was
controlled
and
chest
Physical
Therapy
and
nebulizer
treatments
were
done
.

The
patient
improved
slowly
.

Also
,
his
white
blood
cell
count
was
found
to
rise
to
32.0
;
this
was
most
likely
due
to
a
secondary
infection
of
his
foot
and
Zosyn
was
started
.

The
patient
continued
to
do
well
and
his
recurrent
atrial
fibrillation
slowly
improved
;
p.o.
doses
of
Lopressor
slowly
increased
to
get
better
control
of
his
rate
and
the
patient
was
able
to
be
controlled
with
a
heart
rate
in
the
50s
to
60s
with
Lopressor
.

Following
initiation
of
his
Zosyn
,
the
white
count
continued
to
improve
and
the
patient
was
planned
for
a
PICC
line
for
long-term
intravenous
antibiotics
.

The
patient
was
started
on
Lopressor
75
mg
p.o.
twice
a
day
with
good
control
with
a
heart
rate
of
50s
to
60s
.

He
is
in
sinus
rhythm
.

He
was
also
started
on
his
preoperative
medications
of
Amlodipine
and
Losartan
with
improvement
of
his
blood
pressure
.

The
patient
was
also
reduced
to
400
mg
q.
day
of
amiodarone
.

Pulmonary
was
consulted
at
this
time
for
this
difficulty
of
diuresis
and
pulmonary
edema
.

They
continued
to
agree
with
the
management
of
the
patient
and
with
aggressive
pulmonary
toilet
as
well
as
diuresis
and
nebulizer
treatment
.

The
patient
was
transferred
back
from
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
on
2013-09-13
,
and
upon
arriving
on
the
floor
,
he
continued
to
do
well
.

Pulmonary
toilet
and
aggressive
chest
Physical
Therapy
was
continued
and
the
patient
was
able
to
be
weaned
from
his
oxygen
.

Furthermore
,
his
Foley
catheter
was
removed
and
he
was
started
on
anti-coagulation
for
his
episodes
of
atrial
fibrillation
.

He
had
been
started
on
heparin
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
and
that
was
continued
.

Coumadin
was
then
begun
with
a
goal
INR
of
2.0
to
3.0
.

At
that
time
he
was
stabilized
from
a
cardiac
perspective
.

Podiatry
and
Vascular
Surgery
were
reconsulted
to
assess
the
patient
's
needs
for
revascularization
and
for
his
foot
ulcer
.

It
was
decided
at
that
time
that
the
patient
could
be
discharged
in
follow-up
with
Vascular
Surgery
for
revascularization
and
Podiatry
thereafter
.

On
2013-08-28
,
the
patient
had
a
PICC
line
placed
for
a
six
week
course
of
intravenous
Zosyn
for
his
foot
ulcer
and
his
Coumadin
was
also
continued
.

The
patient
did
well
and
was
discharged
to
a
rehabilitation
facility
at
that
time
.

His
discharge
date
is
pending

HOSPITAL
COURSE
BY
SYSTEM
:

1.
NEUROLOGY
:

Mr.
Roach
was
transported
to
Intensive
Care
Unit
from
the
trauma
bay
.

Upon
arrival
,
Neurosurgery
promptly
placed
V.
Holtzen
bolt
.

This
allowed
continuous
monitoring
of
intracranial
pressure
.

Notably
,
intracranial
pressure
was
17
when
the
bolt
was
placed
.

During
his
hospitalization
,
his
intracranial
pressure
was
monitored
very
closely
and
maintained
to
a
level
of
less
than
20
.

To
do
this
,
mannitol
25
mg
q.
6h.
was
used
.

While
using
mannitol
,
his
serum
osmolalities
were
followed
closely
.

In
addition
,
to
monitoring
his
intracranial
pressure
,
his
systemic
blood
pressures
were
maintained
in
such
a
manner
that
his
cerebral
perfusion
pressure
was
maintained
at
70
mmHg
.

A
parameter
monitor
for
his
neurologic
status
PaCO2
which
was
maintained
between
35
and
40
during
his
hospitalization
.

Mr.
Roach
was
kept
sedated
with
propofol
and
was
given
Fentanyl
and
/
or
morphine
boluses
for
pain
.

Neurologic
checks
were
followed
initially
every
one
hour
and
then
every
two
hours
to
monitor
for
change
in
neurologic
examination
.

During
his
hospitalization
,
two
subsequent
CAT
scans
were
obtained
;
one
on
hospital
day
two
.

This
CAT
scan
revealed
possible
worsening
and
was
read
as
epidural
versus
subdural
bleed
.

After
a
discussion
with
both
Radiology
and
Neurosurgery
,
the
decision
was
made
that
the
worsening
did
not
appear
significant
,
and
this
was
not
accompanied
by
a
change
in
his
clinical
condition
.

His
intracranial
pressure
remained
stable
,
and
his
clinical
examination
was
unchanged
.

An
additional
CT
scan
was
obtained
on
hospital
day
three
.

This
examination
was
unchanged
from
the
previous
examination
.

Again
,
his
intracranial
pressure
and
neurologic
examination
remained
the
same
,
and
conservative
treatment
was
opted
for
.

2.
CARDIOVASCULAR
:

As
described
in
previous
section
,
Neo-Synephrine
and
eventually
Levophed
were
used
to
maintain
a
coronary
perfusion
pressure
of
greater
than
70
.

A
pulmonary
artery
catheter
was
placed
on
hospital
day
four
.

This
catheter
was
placed
when
the
patient
started
to
demonstrate
septic
physiology
and
for
increasing
pressor
support
.

Please
see
Infectious
Disease
section
for
more
details
.

3.
GASTROINTESTINAL
:

Mr.
Roach
was
n.p.o.
from
the
time
of
his
admission
.

A
orogastric
tube
was
passed
.

Initially
during
admission
,
carafate
was
given
down
the
orogastric
tube
.

However
,
on
a
routine
chest
x-ray
shot
on
hospital
day
three
,
a
mediastinum
was
noted
.

This
raised
the
question
of
potential
esophageal
rupture
.

Gastroenterology
was
consulted
for
this
.

Gastroenterology
was
consulted
to
assist
in
creating
the
most
appropriate
diagnostic
rhythm
given
his
intubated
and
sedated
status
.

At
this
point
,
his
carafate
was
switched
to
intravenous
Protonix
and
he
was
strictly
n.p.o.

4.
HEMATOLOGY
:

Throughout
Mr.
Richard
admission
,
his
hematocrit
remained
stable
in
the
low
30s
.

As
will
be
discussed
in
the
Infectious
Disease
section
,
he
developed
an
episode
of
what
appeared
to
be
sepsis
,
and
his
white
blood
cell
count
peaked
at
23
.

Mr.
Roach
was
on
Pneumo
boots
spontaneous
compression
devices
for
deep
venous
thrombosis
prophylaxis
.

He
was
not
a
candidate
for
subcutaneous
heparin
as
we
were
concerned
of
an
intracranial
hemorrhage
.

An
inferior
vena
cava
filter
was
considered
but
was
deferred
,
as
it
was
felt
that
Mr.
Roach
was
too
unstable
to
undergo
the
procedure
.

5.
ENDOCRINE
:

Mr.
Marian
blood
sugar
was
maintained
under
tight
control
from
100
to
130
using
a
regular
insulin
sliding-scale
.

6.
INFECTIOUS
DISEASE
:

Mr.
Roach
had
a
spike
in
white
blood
cell
count
and
developed
fevers
.

His
blood
urine
and
sputum
were
all
cultured
.

Blood
cultures
were
pertinent
for
one
bottle
of
gram
-
positive
coagulase
-
negative
Staphylococcus
which
grew
from
08-25
.

His
preliminary
cultures
including
sputum
from
08-25
grew
Escherichia
coli
.

Sputum
from
08-27
grew
gram-negative
rods
,
not
yet
speciated
,
and
from
08-27
a
bronchoalveolar
lavage
grew
1+
gram-negative
rods
and
4+
polymorphonuclear
lymphocytes
.

Throughout
this
time
,
Mr.
Richard
temperature
continued
to
increase
and
was
such
that
on
hospital
day
four
,
his
temperature
maximum
was
42.2
degrees
centigrade
.

During
his
hospitalization
,
his
was
treated
with
vancomycin
for
his
gram-negative
rods
,
imipenem
,
and
Flagyl
.

Initially
,
he
had
been
placed
on
clindamycin
to
cover
his
drain
,
but
his
cultures
became
positive
,
and
his
white
blood
cell
count
increased
.

He
was
switched
from
clindamycin
to
the
imipenem
and
Flagyl
.

Vancomycin
was
added
when
we
had
the
positive
blood
culture
.

With
a
fever
of
102
,
up
to
42
degrees
centigrade
,
aggressive
measures
including
cooling
blankets
,
alcohol
swabs
,
and
fans
were
used
in
an
attempt
to
bring
his
body
temperature
down
.

Hypercarbia
would
result
and
increase
in
cerebral
perfusion
,
paralysis
was
initiated
to
decrease
genesis
of
carbon
dioxide
secreted
during
shivering
.

7.
PULMONARY
:

As
discussed
in
the
Infectious
Disease
section
,
Mr.
Roach
developed
a
pneumonia
likely
from
gram-negative
organisms
,
but
most
likely
from
Escherichia
coli
.

For
this
pneumonia
,
he
was
placed
empirically
on
imipenem
,
vancomycin
,
and
Flagyl
.

On
hospital
day
three
,
Mr.
Roach
had
developed
an
episode
of
tachycardia
and
tachypnea
.

For
this
,
a
CT
angiogram
was
obtained
which
demonstrated
no
pulmonary
embolism
.

On
hospital
day
four
,
a
routine
chest
x-ray
revealed
a
left-sided
pneumothorax
.

For
this
,
a
left
#34
Caucasian
chest
tube
was
placed
.

On
the
evening
of
hospital
day
four
,
Mr.
Roach
had
an
acute
episode
whereby
his
central
venous
pressure
rose
sharply
and
immediately
followed
by
a
period
of
asystole
.

Urgent
resuscitation
measures
were
initiated
.

The
measures
included
attempts
at
pacing
.

Epinephrine
and
atropine
were
administered
as
were
bicarbonate
and
calcium
.

He
had
a
differential
diagnosis
of
asystole
preceded
by
an
acute
rise
in
central
venous
pressure
included
attention
pneumothorax
,
cardiac
tamponade
,
and
pulmonary
embolism
.

During
the
resuscitation
afterwards
,
it
was
noted
that
a
patent
left
chest
tube
was
present
in
the
left
chest
,
so
initially
neo-decompression
was
attempted
in
the
right
chest
.

There
was
no
sign
of
attention
pneumothorax
with
decompression
,
and
a
right
chest
tube
was
placed
.

During
this
time
,
a
needle
aspiration
of
what
was
felt
to
be
the
pericardium
was
performed
revealing
bloody
fluid
coming
back
.

A
left
anterior
thoracotomy
was
made
by
the
Cardiac
Surgery
fellow
who
was
present
.

After
30
minutes
of
active
resuscitation
including
internal
cardiac
massage
,
there
was
no
evidence
of
return
of
vital
signs
or
electric
activity
to
the
heart
as
noted
on
electrocardiogram
monitors
.

Resuscitation
was
terminated
at
1914
on
08-27
.

After
the
termination
of
resuscitation
,
both
the
anesthesia
Intensive
Care
Unit
attending
and
the
surgical
attending
were
present
to
discuss
the
proceedings
events
with
the
patient
's
family
members
including
his
next
of
kin
,
his
mother
.

Permission
for
a
postmortem
examination
was
granted
.

HISTORY
OF
THE
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
is
a
71
-
year-old
gentleman
who
was
admitted
to
the
St.
Anne
's
Hospital
as
a
transfer
from
the
Kindred
Park
View
Specialty
Hospital
of
Springfield
.

Prior
to
admission
,
he
had
a
long
and
complicated
hospital
course
at
the
outside
hospital
.

His
hospital
course
began
on
2014-02-13
when
he
underwent
a
right
carotid
endarterectomy
for
95%
stenosis
of
the
carotid
artery
.

His
postoperative
course
was
complicated
by
nonspecific
T
wave
changes
consistent
with
myocardial
infarction
postoperatively
as
well
as
hematoma
formation
.

The
hematoma
formation
was
rapidly
expanding
and
he
received
an
emergent
surgical
airway
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

This
emergent
cricothyroidotomy
was
converted
then
to
a
formal
tracheostomy
.

During
his
subsequent
hospital
course
,
he
had
an
additional
CHF
exacerbation
.

He
was
medically
managed
and
eventually
his
tracheostomy
was
decannulated
.

However
,
just
prior
to
admission
to
Mass.
Eye
&
Ear
Infirmary
he
had
another
acute
decompensation
with
CHF
exacerbation
.

This
necessitated
emergent
intubation
.

With
EKG
changes
consistent
with
myocardial
infarction
,
he
was
transferred
to
the
Mass.
Eye
&
Ear
Infirmary
for
further
management
.

.

He
was
afebrile
with
a
temperature
of
99.1
.

His
pulse
was
in
the
70s
,
blood
pressure
119/58
.

He
was
breathing
12
per
minute
and
saturating
98%
.

His
CVP
is
ranging
from
07-27
.

He
was
intubated
and
has
a
nasogastric
tube
.

His

has
a
well-healed
right
carotid
endarterectomy
scar
.

There
is
also
a
well-healing
tracheostomy
scar
.

The
lungs
were
clear
to
auscultation
bilaterally
.

The
heart
was
regular
with
an
S1
and
S2
.

The
abdomen
was
soft
,
nontender
,
nondistended
with
normoactive
bowel
sounds
.

The
extremities
were
without

a
cast
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Mr.
Knueppel
was
admitted
to
the
CCU
at
the
Mass.
Eye
&
Ear
Infirmary
.

Upon
admission
,
he
was
treated
for
his
pneumonia
.

He
was
medically
managed
for
CHF
and
underwent
a
cardiac
catheterization
on
2014-03-06
.

His
catheterization
revealed
70%
stenosis
of
the
distal
left
main
coronary
artery
,
90%
stenosis
of
the
LAD
,
80%
stenosis
of
the
circumflex
,
90%
stenosis
of
OM2
and
a
proximally
occluded
right
coronary
artery
.

After
reviewing
cardiac
catheterization
data
,
a
consultation
was
made
with
Cardiothoracic
Surgery
who
deemed
that
he
was
a
good
candidate
for
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
.

Over
the
ensuing
days
,
Mr.
Nina
CHF
was
managed
by
the
CCU
Team
and
he
received
treatment
for
what
was
now
determined
to
be
a
Klebsiella
pneumonia
.

He
was
treated
with
a
full
course
of
Zosyn
.

On
2014-03-11
,
Mr.
Knueppel
went
to
the
Operating
Room
with
Dr.
Streeter
.

He
underwent
a
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
of
four
vessels
.

He
had
a
saphenous
vein
graft
to
his
LAD
and
diagonal
in
a
sequential
fashion
,
saphenous
vein
graft
to
his
PDA
and
a
saphenous
vein
graft
to
his
OM
.

The
procedure
was
performed
by
Dr.
Streeter
and
assisted
by
Dr
.
.....................

The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
well
without
complication
and
was
transferred
to
the
Cardiac

Surgery
Recovery
Unit
without
complication
.

Please
see
the
previously
dictated
operative
note
for
more
details
.

Mr.
Knueppel
had
a
long
postoperative
course
.

His
postoperative
course
was
complicated
by
hypertension
which
was
managed
medically
.

During
his
postoperative
course
,
he
did
not
suffer
from
any
arrhythmias
nor
did
he
have
any
episode
of
hypotension
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
he
was
on
a
stable
antihypertensive
regimen
appropriate
for
someone
with
a
decreased
ejection
fraction
.

Mr.
Knueppel
had
had
a
long
protracted
period
of
intubation
prior
to
the
operation
.

The
status
of
Mr.
Nina
pulmonary
system
necessitated
a
prolonged
postoperative
intubation
.

After
a
very
slow
wean
from
ventilatory
support
,
Mr.
Knueppel
was
successfully
extubated
on
postoperative
day
number
nine
.

He
continued
to
be
very
tenuous
from
a
pulmonary
point
of
view
and
required
frequent
chest
PT
.

For
this
reason
,
Mr.
Knueppel
was
kept
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
where
very
close
monitoring
could
be
performed
.

In
addition
,
he
had
chest
PT
performed
at
very
regular
intervals
by
the
ICU
staff
.

His
pulmonary
status
was
so
tenuous
that
we
were
unable
to
transfer
him
to
the
regular
patient
care
floor
during
his
hospitalization
.

Mr.
Knueppel
had
an
emergent
cricothyroidotomy
followed
by
a
formal
tracheostomy
at
the
outside
hospital
.

There
is
much
scarring
surrounding
his
larynx
.

Such
a
situation
frequently
makes
it
very
difficult
to
swallow
without
aspirating
.

As
is
expected
,
Mr.
Knueppel
failed
a
swallowing
study
early
on
in
his
Boston
Regional
Medical
Centerr
hospital
course
.

The
study
was
repeated
and
yet
again
Mr.
Knueppel
was
unable
to
swallow
without
evidence
of
aspiration
.

After
a
prolonged
period
of
being
fed
via
nasogastric
tube
,
Mr.
Knueppel
finally
had
a
formal
percutaneous
endoscopic
gastrostomy
tube
placed
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

This
was
performed
on
2014-04-01
,
postoperative
day
number
21
.

This
procedure
was
performed
by
Dr.
Kevin
Taussig
and
assisted
by
Dr.
Carla
Solan
.

The
procedure
was
performed
under
endoscopic
guidance
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
without
complication
.

Please
see
the
previously
dictated
operative
note
for
more
details
.

Mr.
Knueppel
Robertson
a
distal
radius
fracture
prior
to
arriving
to
the
hospital
.

This
injury
had
been
reduced
and
casted
at
the
outside
institution
.

Postoperatively
,
there
was
much
edema
associated
in
the
postoperative
course
from
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
.

His
cast
was
removed
by
the
Orthopedic
Service
in
anticipation
of
this
edema
and
to
avoid
compartment
syndrome
.

The
cast
was
replaced
by
a
plaster
splint
.

Mr.
Knueppel
should
follow-up
with
his
orthopedic
surgeon
in
the
Worcester
State
Hospital
for
reassessment
of
his
injury
and
possible
removal
of
the
splint
.

By
postoperative
day
number
23
,
Mr.
Nina
pulmonary
status
was
deemed
sufficiently
stable
.

His
hypertension
was
well
controlled
and
he
was
tolerating
tube
feeds
.

At
this
point
,
he
was
ready
to
be
discharged
to
rehabilitation
.

This
ecchymosis
is
much
improved
from
previous
examinations
.

There
was
no
increased
warmth
over
this

,
temperature
96.0.

Her
right
foot
was
without
capillary
refill
,
with
a
marked

artery
.

There
was
an
occlusion
in
the
proximal
calf
,
of
the

History
of
Present
Illness
:

The
patient
is
a
78
y/o
WF
w/a
PMH
significant
for
HTN
and
afib
who
presented
to
an
OSH
w/
complaints
of
abd
pain
and
nausea
.

She
was
found
to
have
a
R
ureteral
stone
w/
resultant
hydronephrosis
and
was
transferred
to
Nantucket
Cottage
Hospital
for
ureteral
stent
placement
.

Her
INR
was
found
to
be
elevated
when
admitted
and
,
in
the
course
of
waiting
for
this
to
normalize
,
the
patient
spiked
a
temperature
to
105
and
became
hypotensive
to
the
70s
.

She
was
bolused
w/out
effect
and
had
little
response
to
neo
so
she
was
changed
to
levophed
,
given
doses
of
cipro
/
vanco
/
gent
and
transferred
to
the
CMED
CSRU
for
management
.

In
the
CMED
,
urology
was
consulted
and
the
patient
received
a
R
nephrostomy
tube
.

However
,
tube
placement
was
complicated
by
renal
artery
puncture
,
afib
,
and
increased
dyspnea
.

She
was
intubated
for
this
hypoxia
and
treated
with
lasix
,
metoprolol
,
and
diltiazem
.

She
was
weaned
off
her
pressors
on
02-21
and
maintained
her
pressure
w/out
additional
fluid
boluses
.

Her
sedation
was
weaned
down
and
she
was
successfully
extubated
shortly
thereafter
.

UCx
grew
proteus
and
her
abx
were
changed
to
levaquin
alone
and
she
remained
afebrile
for
>
24
hr
on
this
regimen
.

She
continued
to
have
trouble
with
afib
and
required
a
dilt
gtt
on
the
day
prior
to
call-out
to
control
this
rhythm
but
she
was
transitioned
to
PO
diltiazem
and
has
been
in
NSR
since
this
time
.

She
was
restarted
on
heparin
prior
to
d/c
as
a
bridge
to
therapeutic
coumadin
anticoagulation
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

A/P
:

78
year
old
female
with
history
of
HTN
,
a.fib
presenting
with
ureteral
stone
,
hydronephrosis
,
and
urosepsis
.

She
originally
had
hypotension
and
a
leukocytosis
in
the
ER
and
was
admitted
to
the
CMED
CCU
.

In
the
CMED
,
urology
was
consulted
and
the
patient
received
a
R
nephrostomy
tube
.

However
,
tube
placement
was
complicated
by
renal
artery
puncture
,
afib
,
and
increased
dyspnea
.

She
was
intubated
for
this
hypoxia
and
treated
with
lasix
,
metoprolol
,
and
diltiazem
.

She
was
weaned
off
her
pressors
on
02-21
and
maintained
her
pressure
w/out
additional
fluid
boluses
.

Her
sedation
was
weaned
down
and
she
was
successfully
extubated
shortly
thereafter
.

UCx
grew
proteus
and
her
abx
were
changed
to
levaquin
alone
and
she
remained
afebrile
for
>
24hr
on
this
regimen
.

She
continued
to
have
trouble
with
afib
and
required
a
dilt
gtt
on
the
day
prior
to
call-out
to
control
this
rhythm
but
she
was
transitioned
to
PO
diltiazem
on
the
day
of
call-out
.

1.
Sepsis
-
The
patient
was
septic
in
the
ER
and
her
blood
cultures
eventually
grew
proteus
.

Her
Bcx
remained
negative
throughout
her
stay
.

She
was
treated
with
levaquin
on
the
floor
and
will
complete
a
14d
course
at
rehab
.

She
has
been
afebrile
since
she
was
called
out
to
the
floor
.

2.
Ureteral
stone
-
The
patient
had
a
nephrostomy
tube
placed
by
IR
to
relieve
her
hydronephrosis
.

She
was
followed
by
urology
during
her
stay
and
will
see
them
again
2
wk
after
d/c
for
definitive
treatment
of
her
nephrolithiasis
.

At
this
time
,
urology
will
coordinate
removal
of
her
nephrostomy
tube
with
IR
.

Her
nephrostomy
tube
was
draining
clear
yellow
urine
at
the
time
of
d/c
.

3.
a.fib
-
The
patient
has
a
history
of
atrial
fibrillation
controlled
with
beta
blockers
at
home
.

She
was
treated
in
the
CMED
as
above
.

Once
on
the
floor
,
the
patient
had
one
episode
of
afib
w/
RVR
that
responded
immediately
to
IV
metoprolol
.

Because
of
this
,
the
patient
's
diltiazem
was
stopped
and
she
was
started
on
tid
metoprolol
.

After
this
,
the
patient
had
no
further
problems
with
her
rate
control
.

She
was
maintained
on
a
heparin
gtt
for
bridge
to
coumadin
while
on
the
floor
after
this
was
cleared
by
IR
and
urology
.

She
will
be
d/c
w/out
her
heparin
as
she
is
trending
upwards
with
her
INR
and
has
no
MR
Paul
Paquettec
heart
disease
.

She
will
continue
her
coumadin
at
rehab
to
achieve
an
INR
between
03-22
.

4.
delirium
-
The
patient
had
troubles
with
agitation
while
in
the

SUMMARY
OF
HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Respiratory
:

On
admission
,
the
patient
had
what
appeared
to
be
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
secondary
to
community
-
acquired
pneumonia
.

She
was
maintained
on
a
ventilator
and
ventilated
according
to
ARDSNet
protocol
.

For
antibiotic
coverage
of
her
pneumonia
,
she
was
started
on
Levaquin
,
ceftriaxone
,
and
vancomycin
.

Over
the
next
two
days
after
admission
,
the
patient
's
vent
settings
were
gradually
weaned
,
and
she
was
extubated
two
days
after
being
transferred
to
this
hospital
.

After
extubation
,
the
patient
was
oxygenating
well
on
face
mask
.

She
did
continue
to
have
a
persistent
fairly
severe
cough
;
however
,
her
cough
was
weak
due
to
abdominal
muscle
pain
from
repeated
coughing
.

The
cough
was
mostly
nonproductive
.

The
patient
was
breathing
comfortably
.

As
there
was
no
identified
bacterial
pathogen
on
any
cultures
,
the
patient
was
continued
on
the
triple
antibiotics
for
first
several
days
of
the
hospitalization
.

She
was
also
on
round-the-clock
Atrovent
and
albuterol
nebulizers
.

Once
the
patient
was
transferred
out
of
the
ICU
and
after
extubation
,
the
antibiotics
were
gradually
narrowed
.

The
vancomycin
and
Levaquin
were
discontinued
after
approximately
four
days
in
the
hospital
.

The
ceftriaxone
was
discontinued
after
four
days
in
the
hospital
,
and
the
patient
was
to
continue
on
Levaquin
.

The
patient
had
gradual
improvement
in
her
oxygenation
.

Pain
control
:

The
patient
had
fairly
significant
abdominal
pain
secondary
to
persistent
cough
.

She
was
started
on
a
regimen
of
MS
Contin
with
oxycodone
for
breakthrough
pain
.

This
helped
her
somewhat
though
she
has
continued
to
have
difficulty
coughing
due
to
the
pain
.

Tylenol
and
ibuprofen
were
also
added
for
better
control
.

Transaminitis
:

The
patient
was
noted
to
have
mild
transaminitis
on
admission
.

However
,
this
was
felt
to
be
due
to
her
significant
infection
.

This
should
continue
to
be
followed
as
an
outpatient
to
assure
that
it
returns
back
to
normal
.

Anemia
:

The
patient
's
reticulocyte
count
showed
inadequate
production
.

Iron
studies
showed
a
mixed
picture
with
decreased
iron
and
decreased
iron
to
TIBC
ratio
suggestive
of
iron-deficiency
anemia
,
but
also
normal
to
high
MCV
.

B12
was
noted
to
be
low
and
the
patient
was
given
an
injection
of
IM
B12
while
in
the
hospital
.

She
was
also
started
on
iron
supplementation
.

Hypothyroidism
:

The
patient
was
continued
on
Synthroid
for
her
chronic
hypothyroidism
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Breunlinke
is
a
70-year-old
patient
of
Dr.
Brendniungand
Asilbekote
in
California
.

She
is
referred
for
progressive
angina
.

She
had
rheumatoid
fever
as
a
child
and
a
heart
murmur
noted
but
no
further
testing
.

She
has
used
antibiotic
prophylaxis
since
1980
.

In
1980
she
had
quadruple
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
surgery
by
Dr.
Elks
at
Feargunwake
Otacaa
Community
Hospital
and
did
well
until
1988
when
she
had
exertional
angina
and
a
positive
stress
test
and
found
that
three
or
four
grafts
were
occluded
.

In
October
,
1989
,
Dr.
No
re-did
her
bypass
operation
.

She
had
a
left
internal
mammary
artery
graft
to
the
left
anterior
descending
,
saphenous
vein
graft
to
the
obtuse
marginal
1
and
a
saphenous
vein
graft
to
the
obtuse
marginal
2
.

In
1993
she
had
a
DDD
pacemaker
for
complete
heart
block
.

She
had
exertional
angina
at
that
time
.

In
November
,
1997
she
had
a
small
myocardial
infarction
as
was
transferred
to
Ona
Hospital
where
a
cardiac
catheterization
showed
a
tight
left
internal
mammary
artery
to
left
anterior
descending
stenosis
,
high
grade
saphenous
vein
graft
to
obtuse
marginal
1
stenosis
and
patent
obtuse
marginal
2
graft
.

She
had
normal
left
ventricular
function
with
apical
tip
akinesis
.

Since
that
time
she
has
continued
to
have
exertional
left
chest
burning
,
radiating
to
the
left
neck
and
arm
,
relieved
by
nitroglycerin
.

She
was
turned
down
for
re-do
surgery
at
that
time
and
did
not
have
a
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
.

Because
these
symptoms
have
been
increasing
,
particularly
at
cardiac
rehabilitation
,
she
was
referred
here
.

In
May
,
1998
she
had
an
exercise
tolerance
test
in
which
her
heart
rate
went
to
112
and
her
blood
pressure

HOSPITAL
COURSE
AND
TREATMENT
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Cardiac
Catheterization
Laboratory
.

There
,
her
pulmonary
wedge
pressure
was
12
and
her
right
atrial
pressure
was
4
and
pulmonary
artery
pressure
44/17
.

Her
left
ventricular
contraction
showed
akinesis
of
the
anterior
wall
with
dyskinesis
of
the
apex
.

She
had
preserved
inferior
contraction
and
basal
contraction
.

Her
native
right
and
left
anterior
descending
vessels
were
occluded
as
was
an
obtuse
marginal
branch
.

The
saphenous
vein
to
the
high
diagonal
or
high
obtuse
marginal
was
occluded
.

The
left
internal
mammary
artery
to
the
left
anterior
descending
was
also
occluded
.

The
saphenous
vein
graft
to
the
second
obtuse
marginal
was
open
with
no
significant
stenosis
,
but
there
was
an
outflow
lesion
in
the
obtuse
marginal
2
as
well
as
severe
distal
lesion
as
the
obtuse
marginal
2
fed
the
posterior
descending
artery
.

This
was
considered
her
culprit
lesion
.

This
was
considered
too
high
risk
for
angioplasty
because
of
the
severe
disease
in
the
graft
.

In
addition
,
it
was
noted
that
she
had
saphenous
vein
harvested
from
both
thighs
.

Her
left
internal
mammary
artery
was
also
unused
.

It
was
also
noted
that
she
had
failure
to
sense
with
the
atrial
lead
.

She
would
not
sense
the
atrial
contraction
and
the
fire
and
this
occasionally
led
to
competition
of
firing
.

This
was
intermittent
.

The
P
wave
amplitude
was
.6
and
this
could
not
be
totally
sensed
.

The
patient
was
admitted
for
management
of
her
coronary
artery
disease
and
evaluation
of
her
pacemaker
.

It
was
noted
that
she
became
very
symptomatic
when
she
was
not
on
a
beta
blocker
but
that
on
a
beta
blocker
she
had
significant
pacemaker
failure
.

Her
pacemaker
was
set
to
a
VVI
mode
which
sensed
appropriately
.

She
was
in
sinus
rhythm
with
most
of
the
time
.

When
her
pacemaker
was
in
a
sinus
rhythm
without
a
beta
blocker
,
she
had
significant
angina
.

Carotid
non-invasive
testing
was
unremarkable
.

The
situation
was
reviewed
with
Dr.
Niste
Graft
.

He
felt
the
patient
was
not
a
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
candidate
because
of
the
lack
of
conduit
and
because
of
the
presence
of
a
large
anterior
myocardial
infarction
.

For
this
reason
,
it
was
decided
to
maximize
her
beta
blockers
and
nitrates
.

The
situation
was
reviewed
with
Dr.
No
of
the
Pacemaker
Service
.

On
August
20
,
under
local
anesthesia
the
right
pectoral
region
was
explored
and
the
leads
disconnected
and
the
pulse
generator
changed
to
a
CPI
unit
in
which
the
sensitivity
could
be
adjusted
to
.15
mm.
,
which
permitted
appropriate
atrial
sensing
.

There
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
prior
generator
and
nothing
wrong
with
the
leads
.

It
just
needed
a
unit
that
could
have
more
sensitivity
in
the
atrial
mode
.

She
tolerated
this
well
.

Her
medications
were
resumed
.

She
ambulated
without
difficulty
and
was
discharged
to
home
to
be
followed
medically
for
her
coronary
artery
disease
following
two
failed
bypass
graft
procedure
by
Dr.
Brendniungand
Asilbekote
in
Bi
Masase
,
KS

Course

BRIEF
OVERVIEW
:

57
yo
F
with
h/o
polyglandular
autoimmune
syndrome
initially
admitted
in
May
to
FICU
for
suicide
overdose
then
transferred
to
Whittier
Rehab
Hospital
4
for
depression
,
who
was
transferred
to
the
medical
floor
for
a
syncopal
episode
and
hypotension
to
60
systolic
that
returned
to
baseline
with
2.5L
IVF
who
was
subsequently
transferred
to
the
CMED
CSRU
for
a
recurrent
episode
of
hypotension
,
fevers
and
concern
for
sepsis
.

Initially
when
she
arrived
to
the
floor
she
was
afebrile
,
normotensive
without
signs
of
orthostasis
,
had
a
negative
UA
,
a
clear
chest
xray
and
no
signs
/
symptoms
of
a
fever
.

She
was
slightly
tachycardic
.

She
was
initially
not
started
on
antibiotics
.

She
was
given
a
standing
IVF
order
.

Overnight
she
became
febrile
to
102.3
,
increasingly
tachycardic
to
125
,
and
hypotensive
to
80
systolic
.

She
was
started
on
stress
dose
steroids
and
levo
,
flagyl
,
and
vanco
.

She
was
given
4L
of
fluid
boluses
and
transfered
to
the
CMED
CSRU
.

In
the
CMED
CSRU
,
repeated
attempts
to
place
lines
were
unsuccessful
.

The
above
treatments
were
continued
.

Urine
cultures
returned
with
10-100,000
organisms
coag
negative
staph
.

Blood
cultures
remained
negative
.

Vital
signs
stabilized
and
she
was
transfered
back
to
the
medical
floor
after
2
days
in
the
ICU
.

Stress
dose
steroids
were
planned
for
a
7
day
course
,
antibiotics
were
peeled
back
to
levofloxacin
alone
,
and
a
R
hip
film
revealed
no
loosening
nor
inflammation
.

Echo
showed
normal
function
,
trace
AR
,
and
no
MR
.

She
had
a
normal
RUQ
US
,
as
well
.

On
the
floor
the
patient
remained
stable
hemodynamically
without
recurrent
fever
and
was
stable
for
transfer
back
to
Franciscan
Children
's
Hospital
&
Rehab
Center
4
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
her
potassium
had
been
low
despite
repletion
,
Na
was
elevated
,
as
was
blood
pressure
.

On
recommendation
from
endocrine
,
her
fludrocortisone
was
decreased
from
0.2
to
0.1
(
higher
than
required
doses
of
fludrocort
can
cause
these
symptoms
.
)
.

1.
Hypotension
:

Patient
presented
after
episode
of
hypotension
and
syncope
on
Mass.
Mental
Health
Center
5
.

Initially
it
was
felt
that
this
was
a
result
of
poor
PO
intake
.

She
was
afebrile
without
orthostatic
vital
signs
nor
hypotension
.

She
had
no
symptoms
of
infectious
source
,
normal
UA
,
normal
chest
xray
,
and
no
symptoms
nor
signs
of
injury
after
her
fall
with
syncope
.

Neuro
exam
was
normal
.

Subsequently
overnight
,
she
developed
a
fever
to
102.3
and
recurrent
hypotension
in
the
setting
of
fevers
and
tachycardia
that
was
concerning
for
an
infectious
source
.

She
still
had
no
localizing
signs
of
infection
and
culture
data
was
negative
to
be
negative
.

RUQ
US
was
ordered
and
returned
without
signs
of
infection
later
.

She
was
started
on
stress
dose
steroids
.

She
had
cultures
drawn
,
was
given
tylenol
(
tylenol
screen
prior
to
this
dose
was
negative
,
as
was
a
urine
tox
)
,
was
started
on
levofloxacin
,
metronidazole
,
and
vancomycin
to
cover
emperically
for
hospital
aquired
pneumonia
,
GI
sources
,
and
a
potential
hip
infection
.

Her
transaminases
were
slightly
elevated
,
which
was
later
attributed
to
shock
liver
as
a
result
of
her
period
of
hypotension
.

Lipase
and
amylase
remained
normal
.

In
the
ICU
she
also
received
an
echo
that
revealed
normal
function
and
little
valvular
disease
(
she
has
two
loud
systolic
murmurs
on
exam
)
,
and
a
hip
film
revealing
no
inflammation
nor
loosening
.

Urine
culture
twice
grew
10-100,000
coag
negative
staph
.

A
line
could
not
be
placed
for
technical
reasons
,
however
after
4L
NS
on
the
floor
and
01-30
more
in
the
ICU
via
peripheral
IV
's
she
was
stable
.

She
remained
hemodynamically
stable
with
good
UOP
in
the
setting
of
being
started
on
abx
and
stress
dose
steroids
.

The
steroids
were
thought
to
have
helped
significantly
in
in
the
setting
of
Addison
's
with
possibely
superimposed
infection
.

The
patient
was
planned
for
a
7
day
course
of
stress
dose
steroids
followed
by
a
return
to
her
basal
predinisone
/
fludrocortisone
dose
.

2.
Elevated
LFTs
:

LFTs
wre
elevated
at
presentation
.

Initially
the
differential
was
thought
to
include
shock
liver
from
hypotension
,
hepatitis
,
cholangitis
or
choledocholithiasis
.

Hepatitis
serologies
were
negative
and
the
pt
was
eventually
felt
to
have
had
shock
liver
from
her
hypotensive
episode
as
the
transaminitis
resolved
over
time
.

3.
Hypoparathyroidism
:

This
is
a
chronic
problem
.

calcium
levels
were
followed
with
a
goal
to
keep
them
around
8.0
by
continuing
Calcium
carbonate
,
calcitriol
.

The
pt
required
calcium
gluconate
x1
the
day
prior
to
discharge
.

Per
endocrine
at
the
time
of
discharge
,
the
pt
may
need
an
increase
in
calcium
PO
,
but
at
this
time
they
recommended
no
change
.

It
will
need
to
be
monitored
over
time
.

4.
Addison
's-
The
patient
is
on
basal
prednisone
/
fludrocortisone
.

These
were
initially
continued
as
above
and
later
,
when
she
became
hypotensive
and
febrile
,
stress
dose
steroids
were
started
and
planned
for
a
7
day
course
followed
by
a
return
to
her
prior
dose
of
prednisone
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
her
potassium
had
been
low
despite
repletion
,

Na
was
elevated
,
as
was
blood
pressure
.

On
recommendation
from
endocrine
,
her
fludrocortisone
was
decreased
from
0.2
to
0.1
(
higher
than
required
doses
of
fludrocort
can
cause
these
symptoms.
)
.

5.
DM
:

Light
followed
the
patient
.

She
was
continued
on
her
prior
dose
of
steroids
with
sliding
scale
per
patient
using
a
1:15
carb
counting
scheme
with
a
1:30
correction
factor
.

On
the
day
of
discharge
her
glargine
was
decreased
by
one
unit
because
her
glucose
remained
somewhat
low
in
the
mornings
.

6.
R
Hip
pain
:

Later
in
her
hospital
course
,
the
pt
complained
of
hip
pain
.

A
R
hip
film
was
negative
for
pathology
or
failure
of
her
hip
replacement
.

Pain
was
controlled
with
tylenol
and
the
pt
was
reassured
.

PT
was
consulted
.

The
pt
uses
a
wheelchair
often
at
baseline
due
to
pain
from
arthritis
.

7.
Depression
:

The
pt
was
being
treated
at
Mediplex
Rehab
Hospital
4
for
suicidal
ideation
and
a
suicide
attempt
on
original
admission
with
tylenol
and
oxycodone
.

She
had
planned
this
attempt
carefully
without
the
knowledge
of
those
close
to
her
and
very
much
expected
her
attempt
to
work
.

She
had
been
depressed
for
some
time
but
her
loved
ones
were
very
surprised
at
her
attempt
.

She
remained
very
depressed
at
her
inpatient
admission
and
refractory
to
treatment
.

One
day
prior
to
her
transfer
to
the
medical
floor
she
was
sectioned
to
initiate
ECT
,
which
she
had
previously
refused
.

As
a
result
,
she
was
maintained
on
her
ativan
,
mirtazapine
,
risperidone
,
duloxetine
.

She
did
not
exhibit
psychotic
symptoms
.

She
had
a
1:1
sitter
at
all
times
.

She
denied
any
suicidality
but
did
endorse
depression
.

She
denied
HI
,
SI
,
and
illusions
/
hallucinations
.

Her
mood
appeared
stable
throughout
her
hospitalization
.

She
was
followed
by
psychiatry
in
consultation
while
she
was
on
the
medical
floor
.

The
patient
did
have
heparin
subcutaneously
while
on
the
medical
floor
and
in
the
ICU
.

She
remained
full
code
throughout
the
hospitalization
.

As
on
prior
hospitalization
,
her
HCP
was
shared
by
Dianne
White
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
65
year
old
male
who
sustained
a
small
myocardial
infarction
first
in
1978
,
with
course
thereafter
including
a
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
by
Dr.
Wierst
______________at
Noughwell
Entanbon
Health
in
1986
.

In
1991
he
presented
with
congestive
heart
failure
and
he
underwent
porcine
aortic
valve
replacement
.

In
the
seven
to
eight
months
preceding
admission
,
he
developed
recurrent
angina
with
dyspnea
on
exertion
.

The
patient
was
admitted
for
cardiac
catheterization
in
early
December
,
1993
.

PAST
MEDICAL
HISTORY
:

Significant
for
vertebrobasilar

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

Remarkable
for
an
oriented
,
alert
male
in
no
acute
distress
with
decreased
breath
sounds
at
the
right
base
consistent
with
effusion
and
a
3/6
systolic
murmur
consistent
with
aortic
stenosis
.

His
pulse
exam
was
intact
.

Cardiac
catheterization
demonstrated
elevated
right
and
left-sided
filling
pressures
at
rest
,
with
pulmonary
hypertension
and
normal
cardiac
index
.

There
was
severe
aortic
stenosis
of
70
millimeter
peak
gradient
,
native
three
vessel
disease
with
patent
left
internal
mammary
artery
graft
to
the
left
circumflex
,
dissection
of
the
left
main
was
induced
by
the
catheter
tip
.

A
patent
right
internal
mammary
artery
to
the
left
anterior
descending
artery
and
diagonal
was
noted
,
and
a
patent
saphenous
vein
graft
to
the
posterior
descending
artery
was
present
.

Also
of
note
,
pulmonary
edema
was
induced
by
dye
and
anxiety
and
treated
with
Lasix
,
Morphine
,
oxygen
and
nitroglycerin
.

Post-procedure
he
was
admitted
to
the
CCU
because
of
the
history
of
left
main
dissection
.

He
remained
hemodynamically
stable
but
of
note
,
would
not
tolerate
a
transesophageal
echo
because
of
anxiety-he
would
not
swallow
the
probe
.

Transthoracic
echo
demonstrated
gradients
of
100
peak
and
65
mean
across
the
aortic
valve
and
there
was
mild
aortic
insufficiency
and
ejection
fraction
was
noted
to
be
18%
with
global
hypokinesis
.

The
next
several
days
were
remarkable
for
events
in
which
the
patient
was
quite
agitated
and
was
evaluated
by
Psychiatry
and
treated
with
Ativan
.

The
patient
was
then
evaluated
by
Cardiac
Surgery
for
probable
re-do
aortic
valve
replacement
and
possible
re-do
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
.

In
the
course
of
preoperative
workup
,
Mr.
Has
was
evaluated
completely
by
Psychiatry
with
diagnoses
including
underlying
chronic
depression
well-controlled
on
Prozac
,
underlying
organ
brain
vulnerability
of
unclear
etiology
,
possibly
microvascular
infarct
,
acute
paranoid
and
belligerent
behavior
,
possibly
due
to
medications
.

On
December
12
the
patient
underwent
surgery
,
including
a
re-do
aortic
valve
replacement
with
#
25
St.
Jude
and
re-do
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
times
one
;
saphenous
vein
graft
to
the
posterior
descending
artery
as
a
veno-venous
jump
graft
.

The
total
bypass
time
:

2
hours
25
minutes
.

Total
crossclamp
time
:

1
hour
and
48
minutes
.

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
postoperatively
with
stable
hemodynamics
on
Lidocaine
at
one
,
Dobutamine
at
200
and
Nipride
.

The
patient
was
extubated
by
postoperative
day
#
1
but
was
noted
to
be
relatively
hypoxemic
with
high
oxygen
requirement
.

Chest
x-ray
demonstrating
pulmonary
edema
.

Aggressive
diuresis
was
undertaken
and
the
patient
responded
,
albeit
sluggishly
.

In
addition
,
he
remained
agitated
.

This
was
attributed
to
mild
hypoxia
and
/
or
his
underlying
psychiatric
diagnoses
and
he
was
treated
with
Haldol
appropriately
.

On
day
#
2
the
patient
continued
to
diurese
and
this
was
maintained
with
the
Lasix/
Mannitol
infusion
.

His
urine
output
remained
at
150
to
200
cc.
an
hour
.

Despite
this
,
his
chest
x-ray
continued
to
show
severe
pulmonary
edema
and
the
clinical
picture
correlated
.

He
required
anti-hypertensive
therapy
initially
with
Nipride
which
was
changed
to
Hydralazine
to
avoid
shunting
.

He
received
several
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
to
increase
his
hematocrit
and
oncotic
pressure
.

Very
early
in
the
morning
on
postoperative
day
#
3
,
the
patient
became
acutely
hypoxic
after
several
hours
of
marginal
oxygenation
with
respiratory
rates
in
the
thirties
and
the
patient
was
urgently
intubated
,
without
complication
.

With
positive
pressure
ventilation
and
continued
diuresis
,
his
arterial
blood
gases
improved
.

Throughout
this
he
remained
hemodynamically
stable
.

Exception
was
a
ten
beat
run
of
ventricular
tachycardia
which
was
thought
to
be
ischemic
in
origin
and
treated
with
nitrates
and
Lidocaine
.

His
chest
x-ray
blossomed
to
demonstrate
pulmonary
infiltrate
and
the
patient
began
to
produce
sputum
.

Infectious
Disease
consultation
was
obtained
for
evaluation
of
his
purulent
sputum
and
the
patient
was
covered
with
Vancomycin
,
Ceftazidime
and
Gentamicin
.

Cardiology
evaluation
commented
on
the
patient
&apos;s
increasing
ventricular
ectopy
and
suggested
that
these
were
due
to
an
R
and
T
phenomenon
from
his
pacer
in
the
setting
of
prolonged
QT
interval
.

Consequently
his
Pronestyl
was
discontinued
.

In
addition
,
the
patient
was
given
magnesium
to
bring
his
level
above
2
.

On
the
evening
of
the
18th
,
the
patient
continued
to
remain
hemodynamically
stable
,
although
his
oxygenation
was
clearly
deteriorating
and
more
marginal
.

On
60%
FIO2
his
pO2
was
63
.

It
was
increased
to
65%
with
pO2
of
81
.

At
approximately
7:50
a.m.
,
house
officer
was
called
to
the
room
for
blood
pressure
of
70/40
with
falling
oxygen
saturations
.

The
patient
was
immediately
given
400
mg.
of
Calcium
Chloride
i.v.
push
and
ventilator
disconnected
and
the
patient
manually
ventilated
.

Within
one
minute
,
the
patient
lost
his
blood
pressure
and
CPR
was
initiated
and
code
was
called
.

The
patient
initially
continued
to
have
rhythm
consistent
with
EMV
and
he
was
bolused
with
Levophed
and
given
some
volume
while
compressions
continued
.

The
patient
&apos;s
prothrombin
time
had
been
23
early
the
same
morning
and
tamponade
was
considered
and
thoracotomy
instruments
obtained
.

The
chest
was
opened
partially
and
through
sub-xyphoid
area
it
was
determined
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
tamponade
.

Compressions
were
continued
and
adequate
pulse
was
felt
and
arterial
blood
gases
demonstrated
adequate
oxygenation
and
perfusion
.

The
patient
&apos;s
rhythm
degenerated
to
ventricular
tachycardia
and
he
was
shocked
,
initially
without
response
but
after
several
doses
of
Epinephine
,
one-half
mg.
of
Atropine
and
a
bolus
of
Lidocaine
we
were
able
to
obtain
a
blood
pressure
and
rhythm
only
briefly
,
and
quickly
deteriorated
back
to
ventricular
fibrillation
.

Further
attempts
at
resuscitation
were
unsuccessful
and
the
patient
was
pronounced
dead
at
8:30
a.m.

The
family
has
been
notified
and
autopsy
consent
has
been
obtained
.

An

A

This
small
bowel
obstruction
is
likely
secondary
to
closed

obstruction
.

This
could
be
due
to
internal

or
could
be

.

Other
differential
includes

Infectious
etiology
is
less
likely
due

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Mr.
Le
is
a
seventy
three
year
old
male
who
presents
to
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
,
following
a
self
inflicted
gunshot
wound
to
the
head
.

Mr.
Le
was
found
in
bed
with
a
32
caliber
revolver
at
his
side
.

The
patient
was
apparently
alone
at
home
,
his
neighbors
heard
a
single
shot
,
and
the
paramedics
were
called
.

Upon
arrival
,
they
found
the
patient
in
bed
,
with
notes
nearby
,
listing
his
funeral
home
preferences
and
information
on
his
next
of
kin
.

The
patient
indicates
that
his
neighbors
were
making
excessive
noise
upstairs
from
his
dwelling
,
and
he
found
it
unbearable
.

He
therefore
decided
to
take
his
life
with
a
gun
which
he
had
found
in
the
house
.

Apparently
,
the
gun
belonged
to
his
father
.

On
further
questioning
,
the
patient
described
that
his
father
passed
away
approximately
forty
to
fifty
years
prior
to
his
admission
,
and
the
gun
was
found
in
a
box
in
their
home
.

The
patient
expressed
concern
that
he
had
several
utility
bills
that
he
was
unable
to
pay
.

The
patient
&apos;s
sister
died
eight
years
prior
to
the
patient
&apos;s
admission
of
leukemia
,
and
he
otherwise
has
no
next
of
kin
with
the
exception
of
one
brother
in
Washington
,
with
whom
his
relationship
is
tenuous
.

On
initial
questioning
,
however
,
the
patient
denies
any
recent
losses
.

On
admission
,

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
,
on
the
Neurological
Surgery
Service
of
Lupevickette
L.
Ca
,
M.D.

Prior
to
his
admission
,
the
patient
&apos;s
gunshot
wound
was
sutured
close
in
the
emergency
room
.

The
patient
was
placed
on
suicide
precautions
,
and
was
hydrated
with
an
infusion
of
intravenous
fluid
.

The
patient
was
seen
in
consultation
by
the
Psychiatry
Service
,
who
began
a
battery
of
testing
,
which
continues
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

The
Consulting
Psychiatrist
recommended
a
minimum
of
2
point
restraints
at
all
times
,
and
recommended
the
patient
be
monitored
by
a
sitter
.

Allowing
the
patient
to
ambulate
was
not
recommended
.

From
a
medical
standpoint
,
the
patient
did
well
.

He
was
initially
admitted
to
the
Neurological
Intensive
Care
Unit
where
he
was
closely
monitored
during
the
first
two
days
of
his
hospitalization
.

The
chief
obstacle
was
bringing
his
blood
pressure
under
control
and
this
was
ultimately
achieved
with
a
combination
of
Captopril
and
Nifedipine
.

After
his
blood
pressure
had
stabilized
,
the
patient
was
transferred
to
the
Neurology
Ward
.

Close
monitoring
demonstrated
his
blood
pressure
to
be
stable
and
within
an
acceptable
rang
on
his
dosage
regimen
.

The
Psychiatry
Service
followed
up
extensively
with
the
patient
,
and
his
Psychiatric
progress
is
detailed
in
the
Psychiatry
transfer
note
.

By
the
7th
hospital
day
,
the
patient
was
medically
stable
.

He
had
undergone
full
Psychiatric
evaluation
,
and
was
prepared
for
transfer
to
a
Psychiatric
Hospital
.

Therefore
,
because
of
his
need
for
intense
psychiatric
care
,
the
patient
is
discharged
to
the
Vo
Black
Doylestrictshore
Ft.
Clinics
Medical
Center
on
the
7th
hospital
day
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Jadiara
Harrison
is
twin
#1
born
to
a
17
year-old
primiparous
mother
at
31
weeks
gestation
.

Mother
was
admitted
to
the
Nantucket
Cottage
Hospital
from
Lawrence
General
Hospital
Hospital
on
05-01
with
cervical
effacement
and
preterm
labor
.

She
was
treated
with
magnesium
sulfate
.

She
had
previously
been
admitted
here
at
the
24th
week
after
a
motor
vehicle
accident.
She
was
treated
with
tocolysis
and
betamethasone
at
that
time
.

Due
to
progressing
labor
and
presentation
of
twins
,
delivery
was
by
Cesarean
section
.

Prenatal
screens
were
notable
for
blood
type
0
positive
,
antibody
negative
,
hepatitis
B
surface
antigen
negative
,
RPR
nonreactive
.

Rubella
status
was
not
documented
.

Group
B
strep
status
was
unknown
.

Infant
emerged
from
the
breech
position
.

She
was
vigorous
.

She
was
given
blow-by
oxygen
and
stimulation
.

Her
Apgars
were
7
at
1
minute
and
9
at
5
minutes
.

She
was
brought
to
the
CMED
CSRU
for
further
evaluation
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

ON
admission
,
physical
examination
reveals
a
non
dysmorphic
infant
,
well
saturated
and
perfused
with
multiple
bruises
noted
over
the
upper
legs
,
left
arm
and
chest
.

No
bony
abnormalities
or
petechiae
noted
.

She
was
moving
all
joints
and
extremities
well
.

HEENT
:

Within
normal
limits
.

CV
:

Normal
S1
and
S2
without
a
murmur
.

Lungs
were
clear
.

Abdomen
was
benign
.

Genitalia
normal
.

Premature
female
.

Neuro
:

Non
focal
and
age
appropriate
.

Hips
normal
,
held
in
the
breech
position
.

Anus
patent
.

Spine
intact
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Respiratory
:

On
admission
,
infant
did
not
require
supplemental
oxygen
or
respiratory
support
.

Since
that
time
,
Jadiara
has
always
been
in
room
air
without
requiring
supplemental
oxygen
.

She
was
noted
to
have
apnea
of
prematurity
,
treated
with
caffeine
until
2017-06-04
.

Since
that
time
,
she
has
had
very
rare
spells
,
with
none
for
over
one
week
by
the
time
of
discharge
.

Cardiovascular
:

She
was
hemodynamically
stable
upon
admission
with
normal
blood
pressures
and
heart
rate
.

On
day
of
life
15
,
she
was
noted
to
have
a
murmur
,
eventually
prompting
evaluation
by
ECHO
.

The
ECHO
revealed
an
anomalous
left
coronary
,
with
one
end
entering
the
right
ventricular
outflow
tract
and
the
other
end
not
clearly
defined
.

It
was
unable
to
be
delineated
whether
this
represented
an
anomalous
left
coronary
artery
arising
from
the
pulmonary
artery
(
LCAPA
)
or
a
left
coronary
artery
fistula
to
the
pulmonar
artery
.

The
right
coronary
was
prominent
,
and
there
appeared
to
be
coronary
artery
collateral
vessels
in
the
posterior
apical
myocardium
.

A
small
apical
muscular
VSD
was
also
noted
.

Several
additional
ECHOs
were
performed
,
including
an
ECHO
in
the
cardiology
department
at
HealthSouth
Rehab
Hospital
of
Western
Mass.
,
but
the
anatomy
of
the
left
coronary
artery
could
not
be
further
defined
.

Due
to
the
risks
of
coronary
ischemia
if
this
represented
an
LCAPA
,
the
infant
was
followed
with
regular
ECHOs
and
EKGs
during
the
remainder
of
hospitalization
,
with
no
evidence
of
ischemia
,
valvular
regurgitation
,
or
compromised
ventricular
function
.

She
will
be
continued
to
be
followed
closely
by
cardiology
as
an
outpatient
,
with
likely
plans
for
cardiac
catheterization
and
surgical
repair
when
she
grows
to
3.5
to
4
kg
.

Fluids
,
electrolytes
and
nutrition
:

The
infant
was
initially
maintained
on
IVF
,
with
introduction
of
enteral
feeds
on
day
of
life
2
.

She
was
advanced
to
full
volume
enteral
feeds
by
day
of
life
7
,
and
then
to
a
maximum
caloric
density
of
28
cals
/
oz
.

Oral
feedings
were
introduced
as
tolerated
.

By
the
time
of
discharge
,
infant
is
feedign
BM
or
enfamil
24
cals
/
oz
PO
ad
lib
,
with
adequate
intake
and
adequate
weight
gain
.

Last
nutrition
labs
were
on
06-20
with
AP
of
208
,
Ca
10.8
,
and
Phos
7.4.

Gastrointestinal
:

The
infant
required
phototherapy
for
hyperbilirubinemia
through
day
of
life
7
,
with
peak
bilirubin
of
7
/
0.3
on
day
of
life
3
,
and
last
bilirubin
of
4.9
/
0.3
on
day
of
life
9
.

Hematologic
/
Infectious
disease
:

CBC
and
blood
culture
were
obtained
upon
admission
revealing
a
white
blood
cell
count
of
9.0
with
25
polys
and
0
bands
;
hematocrit
was
46.9%
and
platelets
of
222,000
.

Baby
received
48
hours
of
Ampicillin
and
Gentamycin
with
negative

and
a
stable
clinical
course
.

Infant
was
treated
with
supplemental
iron
,
and
did
not
receive
any
blood
transfusions
.

the
time
of

.

Her
hematocrit
was
31.1
,
WBC
11.6
and
151,000
platelets
.

PLAN
:

The
patient
is
thus
stage
IV
endometrial
and
stage
III-C
ovarian
vs
metastatic
endometrial
for
line
II
,
cycle
I
chemotherapy
IFEX
,
MESNA
and
VP-16
.

The
plan
was
for
urinalysis
q
d
.

With
the
history
of
DVT
,
we
plan
Coumadin
and
check
her
coags
.

The
patient
was
tachycardiac
on
admission
and
it
was
felt
she
was
dehydrated
and
/
or
anxious
at
the
time
of
her
initial
evaluation
.

EKG
showed
sinus
tachycardia
and
incomplete
right
bundle
branch
block
.

When
compared
with
ECG
of
11-06-90
,
there
was
borderline
criteria
for
anterior
MI
although
the
patient
denied
any
chest
pain
at
any
point
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
underwent
chemotherapy
on
the
following
doses
:

IFEX
1.2
grams
per
meter
squared
x
3
days
,
MESNA
1.2
grams
per
meter
squared
x
3
days
continuous
IV
infusion
.

She
had
VP-16
mixed
with
250
cc
IV
fluid
given
over
1
hour
each
day
for
3
days
.

She
also
had
MESNA
dose
of
.6
grams
per
meter
squared
after
her
IFEX
/
MESNA
were
completed
.

The
patient
's
urinalysis
on
admission
was
significant
for
red
blood
cells
which
were
TNTC
as
well
as
uric
acid
.

Because
it
was
felt
the
patient
was
bleeding
and
the
patient
was
contaminated
,
she
received
her
IFEX
/
MESNA
.

A
repeat
straight
cath
was
negative
for
RBC
's
.

After
1
day
of
chemotherapy
,
the
patient
had
8-10
RBC
's
in
her
urine
but
by
the
second
day
of
her
IFEX
infusion
,
she
had
50-80
RBC
's
in
her
urine
as
well
as
a
few
transitional
epithelial
cells
.

Because
of
this
finding
,
her
IFEX
was
stopped
before
completion
of
her
second
day
of
infusion
.

Her
MESNA
alone
was
continued
at
that
time
for
IV
infusion
.

She
did
receive
her
VP-16
without
complication
.

Other
significant
issues
were
the
patient
's
hematocrit
on
admission
at
31.1
which
dwindled
down
to
26.2
by
9-10
.

The
patient
was
counselled
and
received
2
units
of
packed
RBC
's
at
that
time
.

However
,
the
patient
's
hematocrit
bumped
only
to
28.1
and
a
repeat
later
on
9-11
,
showed
hematocrit
of
27.6
.

At
this
time
,
an
additional
2
units
of
packed
RBC
's
were
transfused
.

The
third
issue
was
that
her
anticoagulation
was
grossly
out
of
control
on
admission
with
PT
of
25.6
and
PTT
of
42.2
.

Her
repeat
on
9-8
,
was
36.0
/
68.2
and
her
Coumadin
was
held
.

She
received
no
Coumadin
during
her
admission
and
by
the
time
of
discharge
,
her
PT
was
down
to
16.2
.

She
was
restarted
on
Coumadin
2.5
mg
per
day
.

The
patient
's
hematocrit
on
the
day
of
discharge
was
35.6
showing
significant
bump
in
her
count
after
her
second
two
units
of
packed
RBC
's
.

Her
PT
on
the
day
of
discharge
was
13.2
and
she
was
started
on
Coumadin
2.5
mg
po
q
d
as
mentioned
.

The
patient
was
discharged
on
9-12-92
,
with
the
approval
of
her
attending
physiciana

an
87-year-old
male
with
stage
D
prostate
was
cancer
,
was
admitted
for
fluid
hydration
on
the
10th
of
March
.

The
patient
was
initially
diagnosed
with
prostate
cancer
in
August
of
1989
.

He
presented
with
gross
hematuria
at
that
time
.

Subsequent
prostatic
biopsy
revealed
a
Gleason
's
IV
,
plus
V
tumor
and
the
CT
showed
an
irregular
large
prostate
with
tumor
invasion
into
the
bladder
and
evidence
of
bilateral
retroperitoneal
lymph
node
spread
.

There
was
also
evidence
of
bone
metastasis
at
that
time
.

The
patient
was
admitted
in
October
of
1991
for
urinary
retention
and
acute
renal
failure
and
was
treated
with
fluid
rehydration
and
Foley
catheter
placement
.

Over
the
past
one
month
prior
to
admission
,
the

two
weeks
,
although
there
was
no

of
46.2%
,
sodium
144
,
potassium
3.9
,
creatinine
25
,
and
BUN
was
1.4
with
a
blood
sugar
of
88
.

Urinalysis
demonstrated
30-50
white
blood
cells
with
red
blood
cells
too
numerous
to
count
and
2+
bacteria
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
with
a
diagnosis
of
prostate
CA
,
for
fluid
rehydration
.

Initially
,
the
patient
was
begun
on
Bactrim
for
presumptive
urinary
tract
infection
and
the
initial
course
of
his
hospitalization
,
he
took
p.o.'
s
poorly
.

The
patient
remained
afebrile
,
however
,
and
his
electrolytes
were
within
normal
limits
.

By
hospital
day
number
six
,
however
,
the
patient
became
febrile
to
100.7
and
repeat
urinalysis
showed
20-30
white
blood
cells
and
1+
bacteria
.

Antibiotics
were
switched
to
IV
Ciprofloxacin
and
the
patient
defervesced
;
however
,
by
hospital
day
number
seven
,
the
patient
was
found
to
be
passing
very
little
urine
through
his
condom
catheter
and
electrolyte
screen
and
electrolytes
from
hospital
day
number
seven
showed
a
BUN
of
27
and
a
creatinine
of
2.7
.

The
patient
was
vigorously
fluid
rehydrated
;
however
,
by
hospital
day
number
nine
,
BUN
was
22
,
creatinine
was
3.5
.

A
Foley
catheter
was
placed
at
that
time
with
the
recovery
of
approximately
800
cc
of
urine
.

Subsequently
,
the
patient
began
vigorously
diuresing
with
4
liters
urine
recovered
the
following
hospital
day
.

Blood
electrolytes
were
remarkable
for
a
sodium
of
148
and
a
potassium
of
5.1
.

The
patient
's
fluid
hydration
from
D5
one-half
normal
saline
with
20
mEq
of
K
to
D5W
and
acuchecks
from
this
time
showed
blood
sugars
routinely
between
20
and
50
.

The
patient
was
given
one
Amp
of
D50
for
each
acucheck
for
blood
sugars
of
less
than
40
.

Gradually
over
the
course
of
the
following
days
,
the
patient
's
electrolytes
again
normalized
;
however
,
as
the
patient
continues
to
take
p.o.'
s
poorly
,
the
patient
remained
on
IV
hydration
therapy
.

On
hospital
day
number
fourteen
,
electrolytes
were
sodium
of
140
,
potassium
3.9
,
BUN
of
11
,
creatinine
1.3
with
a
blood
sugar
of
125
and
a
magnesium
of
1.9
.

The
patient
was
taking
470
cc
of
liquid
p.o.
and
is
now
in
stable
condition
and
ready
for
transfer
to
El
Hospital
to
continue
his
recovery
.

DISPOSITION
:

The
patient
is
transferred
to
El
Hospital
,
still
receiving
IV
hydration
at
a
rate
currently
of
50
cc
an
hour
of
D5
one-half
normal
with
20
mEq
of
K
.

Should
the
patient
's
p.o.
intake
drop
to
below
500
,
the
patient
should
be
hydrated
at
75
cc/hour
.

If
the
patient
's
p.o.
intake
drop
below
300
cc
per
day
,
the
patient
should
be
hydrated
at
100
cc
an
hour
.

The
Foley
catheter
was
in
place
and
the
Bacitracin
ointment
should
be
applied
to
the
urethral
meatus
twice
a
day
.

Periodic
urinalysis
should
be
conducted
to
monitor
the
development
of
possible
urinary
tract
infection
.

It
should
be
noted
that
while
in
the
hospital
,
the
patient
received
an
abdominal
ultrasound
which
is
significant
for
a
grossly
enlarged
liver
with
multiple
foci
of
cancer
.

The
patient
is
discharged
on
Mylanta
30
cc
with
meals
,
Carafate
1
gm
q.
6
,
Heparin
5000
units
subcutaneous
b.i.d.
until
the
patient
regains
full
activity
and
IV
hydration
.

The
Foley
should
be
in
place
until
a
follow-up
appointment
with
Dr.
Aarhalt
can
be
scheduled
in
approximately
one
to
two
weeks
at
which
time
a
decision
regarding
the
status
of
the
patient
's
urinary
obstruction
will
be
addressed
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1.
Falls-A
PT
consult
was
obtained
to
assist
with
ambulation
.

A
social
work
consult
was
also
obtained
and
deemed
that
the
patient
has
appropriate
support
at
home
and
is
safe
at
home
.

The
patient
was
placed
on
telemetry
and
had
no
telemetry
events
while
an
inpatient
.

He
was
also
seen
by
the
Electrophysiology
service
,
his
pacemaker
was
interrogated
and
working
fine
,
with
no
signs
of
recent
ventricular
arrhythmia
.

The
patient
his
undergoing
a
TTE
prior
to
discharge
to
rule
out
a
thrombus
.

His
TTE
showed
EF
45-50%
,
moderate
cLVH
,
abnormal
diastolic
function
,
moderate
MR
,
moderate
TR
and
severe
LAE
.

THere
was
a
question
of
ionfiltrative
cardiomyopathy
,
and
the
patient
underwent
abdominal
fat
pad
biopsy
to
assess
for
amyloidosis
.

He
also
currently
has
an
SPEP
/
UPEP/Beta
2
microglobulin
/
ACE
test
that
are
currently
pending
.

These
should
be
followed
up
as
an
outaptient
.

He
had
carotid
ultrasound
studies
3
months
ago
that
were
normal
without
evidence
for
stenosis
.

2.
Renal
-
cont
MWF
HD
;
electrolytes
have
been
stable
.

Perhaps
his
recent
falls
are
related
to
orthostatic
hypotension
after
dialysis
.

3.
CV
-The
pt
has
a
small
area
of
reversible
ischemia
on
recent
MIBI
,
and
has
troponins
persistently
elevated
in
the
setting
of
his
renal
disease
.

His
troponins
remained
lower
than
his
baseline
levels
and
there
was
no
suspicion
of
ACS
causing
syncope
.

He
continued
on
his
zocor
,
cozaar
and
labetalol
.

We
will
now
hold
his
coumadin
given
his
recent
falls
and
bleeding
risk
.

His
aspirin
was
restarted
prior

sinuses
,
complicated
by
ARS
due
to
medication
toxicity
,
as
well
as
GVHD
and
recent
CMV
infection
,

.

Patient
initially
presented
in
1991
with
cervical
lymphadenopathy
,

2001
,
he
progressed
to
leukemic
phase
,
received

on
admission
included
a
chest
x-ray
negative
for
pneumonia
,
an
MRI
of
the
liver
to
investigate
for
focal
lesion
,
with
no
evidence
for
abscess
or
focal
lesion
on
report
.

Blood
and
urine
cultures
with
only
positive
culture
a
blood
culture
on
November
20
,
with
one
of
two
bottles
positive
for
coagulase
negative
Staphylococcus
.

A
repeat
CMV
hypercapture
,
negative
for
presence
of
CMV
.

A
repeat
CAT
scan
of
the
sinuses
with
finding
of
progressive
thickening
of
the
left
maxillary
sinus
and
both
sets
of
ethmoid
air
cells
since
prior
study
of
November
9
,
indicating
progressive
infection
of
Acanthamoeba
and
any
possible
superinfection
with
bacterial
sinusitis
.

In
the
days
following
admission
,
there
was
clear
evidence
for
progression
of
erythematous
nodules
over
both
arms
and
right
thigh
at
foci
of
Acanthamoeba
infection
,
suggesting
progressive
skin
involvement
with
Acanthamoeba
.

Infectious
disease
consult
was
obtained
and
recommendation
was
to
switch
from
voriconazole
to
itraconazole
,
on
which
there
was
more
existing
data
on
treatment
of
Acanthamoeba
infection
.

Pentamidine
intravenous
and
nasal
washings
were
continued
.

Clinical
progression
of
skin
and
sinus
infection
on
maximal
antimicrobial
therapy
continued
,
with
emergence
on
November
20
of
a
new
right-sided
ptosis
in
association
with
a
left
homonymous
hemianopsia
,
and
fleeting
confusion
while
febrile
,
prompting
head
MRI
which
revealed
a
large
5
x
2
x
4.3
cm
region
in
the
right
occipital
lobe
of
hemorrhage
and
edema
,
with
dural
and
,
likely
,
leptomeningeal
enhancement
in
association
with
small
foci
in
the
right
cerebellum
and
pons
,
concerning
for
early
lesions
of
similar
type
.

Idiosyncratic
reaction
to
cyclosporine
was
considered
as
cause
for
cerebritis
,
and
cyclosporine
was
discontinued
.

However
,
much
more
likely
explanation
is
progressive
infection
of
Acanthamoeba
with
new
neurologic
involvement
.

Most
likely
source
of
fevers
was
judged
to
be
progressive
Acanthamoeba
infection
,
even
on
maximal
antimicrobial
therapy
.

A
single
blood
culture
positive
for
coagulase
negative
Staphylococcus
was
treated
with
a
course
of
vancomycin
in
the
setting
of
a
PICC
line
and
a
chest
x-ray
on
November
20
indicating
possible
developing
pneumonia
,
resulted
in
a
course
of
levofloxacin
,
for
both
possible
pneumonia
,
as
well
as
treatment
of
any
bacterial
superinfection
of
Acanthamoeba
sinusitis
.

Patient
experienced
steady
decline
,
with
persistent
fevers
despite
all
above
measures
,
progressive
areas
of
skin
infection
,
more
frequent
episodes
of
confusion
,
and
decreasing
oxygen
saturation
in
the
setting
of
bilateral
effusion
,
in
the
setting
of
fluid
surge
spacing
.

On
November
30
,
a
family
meeting
with
patient
&apos;s
daughter
and
spouse
,
along
with
primary
oncologist
,
Dr.
Tomedankell
Bile
,
attending
physician
,
Dr.
Mellerny
Close
,
and
house
staff
,
was
held
to
discuss
patient
&apos;s
critical
condition
and
inability
to
prevent
progression
of
skin
,
sinus
and
neurological
Acanthamoeba
infection
on
maximal
antimicrobial
therapy
.

Decision
was
made
to
withdraw
aggressive
measures
of
care
,
with
priority
on
patient
&apos;s
comfort
.

Pentamidine
,
itraconazole
,
Levaquin
,
acyclovir
and
GCSF
were
discontinued
,
along
with
other
medications
nonessential
to
patient
&apos;s
comfort
.

DNR
/
DNI
status
initially
established
early
during
hospital
stay
remained
in
effect
.

The
patient
was
made
comfortable
with
morphine
for
pain
and
for
air
hunger
,
and
sinus
suctioning
was
continued
to
relieve
congestion
,
in
conjunction
with
continuation
of
nasal
sprays
.

Tylenol
was
continued
to
control
fevers
and
prednisone
was
continued
to
control
inflammation
and
prevent
precipitation
of
adrenal
insufficiency
.

Such
measures
have
been
continued
through
December
3
,
and
patient
remains
comfortable
through
this
time
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Mr.
Reese
Jones
the
procedure
well
.

Post-operatively
,
he
was
slow
to
recover
but
did
progressed
nicely
.

Within
the
fist
few
days
after
the
surgery
,
his
liver
function
tests
were
elevated
to
as
high
as
1484
for
ALT
,
915
for
AST
,
and
7.6
for
total
bilirubin
.

His
Alk
Phos
were
inititially
low
a
few
days
after
the
operation
,
but
it
rised
up
to
422
two
weeks
after
,
but
down-trended
,
as
with
the
rest
of
his
liver
function
test
by
the
time
he
left
the
hospital
.

Several
tests
,
including
Duplex
Ultrasound
,
CT
of
the
Abdomen
,
and
Abdominal
A-gram
all
showed
patent
right
and
left
hepatic
arteries
arising
from
the
celiac
trunk
.

An
ERCP
was
also
done
,
showing
a
filling
defect
from
a
narrowed
donor
duct
,
but
no
strictures
.

A
sphincterotomy
wss
done
to
drain
the
sludge
from
the
central
common
duct
.

There
was
a
small
bleed
resulting
from
the
sphincterotomy
,
but
it
was
controlled
by
epinepherine
injections
.

Initial
biopsy
of
the
allograft
three
days
after
the
operation
was
consistent
with
preservation
/
ischemic
injury
.

Result
of
a
second
biopsy
,
which
was
done
three
weeks
after
the
operation
,
is
still
pending
.

During
his
hospital
stay
,
his
blood
glucose
were
elevated
and
labile
ranging
from
below
normal
values
[
40-60
's]
to
the
200-300
's
.

He
was
completely
assymptomatic
while
below
normal
values
.

At
one
point
,
he
had
to
be
on
an
insulin
drip
.

However
with
the
help
of
Albano
,
his
blood
glucose
began
to
normalize
.

He
has
also
been
working
with
Physical
Therapy
to
regain
his
strength
.

He
has
been
ambulating
on
his
own
several
times
a
day
.

Also
,
he
has
been
afebrile
with
stable
vitals
,
tolerating
a
regular
diet
,
producing
good
urine
and
adequate
stool
.

Furthermore
,
he
has
had
no
complaints
,
including
pain
,
while
his
lab
values
are
normalizing
.

He
will
be
discharged
to
home
,
in
good
condition
,
with
very
specific
intructions
to
follow
up
with
Albano
for
his
diabetic
care
and
the
Transplant
Clinic
for
his
transplant
care
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

The
patient
was
re-admitted
to
the
surgical
service
and
taken
to
the
CMED
.

A
chest
x-ray
on
admission
showed
effusions
consistent
with
CHF
along
with
overlying
pnumonia
.

Urine
cultures
were
significant
for
Klebsiella
UTI
and
sputum
cultures
were
significant
for
MRSA
.

He
was
placed
on
vancomycin
,
levofloxacin
and
fluconazole
.

He
underwent
PICC
line
placement
on
06-18
.

A
trach
collar
was
placed
on
06-19
.

GI
was
consulted
for
colonoscopy
.

Patient
was
transferred
to
the
floor
on
06-20
.

He
was
seen
by
respiratory
therapy
and
suctioned
continually
throughout
his
hospital
course
.

His
respiratory
status
improved
.

He
tolerated
his
trach
collar
,
and
tube
feeds
at
goal
.

The
fluconazole
was
discontinued
.

On
06-21
the
patient
was
seen
by
physical
therapy
.

A
nutrition
consult
was
obtained
on
06-22
.

He
underwent
a
failed
bedside
swallow
study
.

Based
on
a
chest
x-ray
that
showed
a
small
hydro-pneumothorax
on
the
left
lower
lobe
of
the
lung
,
a
thoracic
surgery
consult
was
obtained
,
though
no
specific
interventions
were
warranted
at
the
time
.

On
06-23
the
patient
's
tube
feed
were
changed
from
Respalor
to
Deliver
2.0
to
give
increased
calories
.

On
06-25
,
urine
cultures
grew
out
VRE
,
and
a
C
diff
was
negative
.

He
experienced
low
grade
fevers
.

He
was
pan-cultured
on
06-26
for
continued
fevers
.

On
06-27
,
his
nutrition
regimen
was
changed
to
Deliver
2.0
at
70
cc
/
hr
with
15
g
ProMod
.

On
06-28
,
the
patient
experienced
PVC
's
.

An
EKG
showed
ST
segment
depression
along
the
lateral
pre-cordial
leads
.

Serial
enzymes
showed
mild
elevation
of
troponins
.

A
cardiology
consult
was
obtained
.

The
cardiology
service
simply
recommended
increasing
the
beta-blockade
and
maximizing
the
patient
's
electrolyte
status
.

On
06-29
,
the
patient
was
transferred
to
the
medical
service
.

Pt
's
vancomycin
was
stopped
after
14
days
of
treatment
.

HIV
test
was
found
to
be
negative
.

MRI
head
was
obtained
to
further
w/u
patient
's
apparent
cognitive
decline
.

MRI
showed
prominent
sulci
and
enlarged
ventricles
abnormal
for
the
patient
's
age
.

Due
to
concerns
for
dementia
,
neurology
consult
was
obtained
.

Neurology
felt
that
the
patient
's
cognitive
symptoms
were
consistent
w/
metabolic
encephalopathy
due
to
his
multiple
medical
problems
.

They
felt
that
his
mental
status
would
improve
as
his
health
improved
.

Underlying
dementia
was
possible
but
difficult
to
assess
with
an
overlying
delerium
.

The
patient
continued
to
pull
out
his
doboff
tube
.

Pt
had
EGD
performed
to
evaluate
his
poor
nutritional
status
.

He
was
found
to
have
a
large
gastric
ulcer
and
high
dose
PPI
was
started
.

The
gastric
biopsy
and
the
serology
were
both
negative
for
H.
pylori
.

PEG
placement
was
unsuccessful
by
GI
due
to
the
patient
's
anantomy
.

07-05
the
patient
had
a
J
tube
placed
in
interventional
radiology
for
nutritional
support
.

He
was
re-started
on
tube
feeds
.

07-06
patient
failed
a
repeat
swallow
evaluation
due
to
discoordinated
swallow
.

07-07
the
patient
was
taken
for
colonoscopy
and
found
to
have
a
normal
colon
to
cecum
.

07-12
the
patient
was
found
to
be
C
diff
positive
and
was
started
on
14
day
course
of
Flagyl
.

On
07-18
,
as
his
mental
status
improved
,
he
did
well
at
the
bed
side
swall
evaluation
.

On
07-19
,
he
underwent
video
swallow
evaluation
and
was
able
to
tolerate
ground
consistent
food
and
thin
liquids
.

His
meds
should
be
crushed
and
mixed
with
puree
thick
liquid
.

He
has
gained
30
lb
since
the
tubefeed
was
initiated
(
70
lb
to
100
lb
)
during
this
admission
.

He
will
still
need
to
be
on
tubefeed
to
support
his
nutrition
until
he
is
cleared
by
a
nutritionist
.

In
terms
of
his
mental
status
,
he
continued
to
improve
steadily
over
the
last
few
weeks
of
his
hospital
stay
.

He
was
more
alert
and
engaged
with
activity
.

He
did
much
better
with
PT
and
OT
at
the
end
after
his
mental
status
improved
.

As
noted
above
,
his
mental
status
change
was
likely
toxic-metabolic
from
acute
infection
.

He
started
to
develop
more
pain
around
the
right
stump
since
07-17
.

He
was
seen
by
the
vascular
surgery
who
felt
that
he
is
too
medically
sick
and
malnourished
to
have
surgery
at
this
time
.

He
will
follow
up
with
Dr.
Javier
as
outpatient
.

Initially
,
his
pain
was
controlled
with
titrating
up
the
Oxycontin
.

However
,
it
was
titrated
too
quickly
from
10
mg
bid
to
30
mg
bid
.

He
then
developed
urinary
retention
requiring
foley
placement
.

After
he
passed
the
video
swallowing
,
he
was
tolerating
ground
consistent
solids
.

On
07-24
,
he
had
an
emesis
x
1
,
and
had
aspiration
pneumonia
(
+
interstital
markings
on
the
left
on
CXR
,
fever
,
leukocytosis
)
.

His
Flagyl
course
was
extended
,
and
Vanc
/
Levo
were
added
.

His
sputum
showed
many
GPC
which
later
grew
Staph
aureus
.

Given
his
recent
MRSA
pneumonia
,
he
will
be
treated
with
2
week
course
of
Vanc
/
Levo
/
Flagyl
.

He
was
seen
by
the
pain
service
who
recommended
to
discontinue
Oxycontin
,
and
start
Neurontin
,
MSIR
,
and
lidocaine
patch
in
addition
to
the
standing
Tylenol
.

On
07-25
,
his
J-tube
was
noted
to
be
obstructed
but
was
able
to
be
flushed
by
IR
on
07-26
.

Tubefeed
was
resumed
without
any
difficulty
since
.

Since
oxycontin
was
discontinued
,
the
foley
was
removed
on
07-27
and
was
able
to
void
without
any
difficulty
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
28
-
year-old
,
gravida
3
,
para
1
,
at
approximately
27
weeks
gestation
,
who
was
admitted
on
2014-05-12
due
to
increasing
symptoms
of
congestive
heart
failure
.

She
has
known
dilated
cardiomyopathy
with
a
baseline
ejection
fraction
of
approximately
25%
.

She
had
been
managed
as
an
outpatient
during
her
pregnancy
and
was
on
multiple
medications
including
Lasix
40
mg
daily
,
Hydralazine
25
mg
daily
,
Toprol
XL
100
mg
daily
,
digoxin
0.5
mg
daily
and
Lovenox
40
mg
twice
daily
subcutaneously
.

She
also
took
albuterol
on
a
p.r.n.
basis
for
her
asthma
.

She
has
known
allergy
to
penicillin
,
vancomycin
and
erythromycin
.

She
was
evaluated
upon
presentation
by
the
Maternal
Fetal
Medicine
attending
on
call
as
well
as
by
Cardiology
.

She
was
found
to
have
symptoms
of
congestive
heart
failure
as
well
as
decreased
fetal
movement
.

Fetal
monitoring
initially
on
admission
was
appropriate
for
gestational
age
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

On
physical
exam
,
she
was
noted
to
have
bilateral
lower
extremity
edema
,
mildly
elevated
pressures
in
the
140
to
150/90
range
,
and
jugular
venous
distension
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

After
consultation
with
Cardiology
as
well
as
Anesthesia
on
call
that
evening
,
it
was
decided
to
transfer
the
patient
to
the
ICU
for
intensive
monitoring
.

Central
IV
access
was
obtained
.

The
patient
was
carefully
diuresed
over
the
next
48
hours
.

Symptoms
of
congestive
heart
failure
gradually
abated
over
the
next
48
to
72
hours
.

The
patient
was
given
antenatal
corticosteroids
for
fetal
lung
maturity
.

A
Neonatology
consultation
was
obtained
during
the
course
of
the
hospitalization
.

After
discussion
,
it
was
decided
to
attempt
to
obtain
28
weeks
gestation
and
then
deliver
electively
by
cesarean
section
given
the
decompensation
in
the
third
trimester
.

The
patient
underwent
primary
low
transverse
cesarean
section
on
2014-05-19
at
approximately
28
weeks
gestation
.

The
cesarean
section
was
performed
on
the
West
Campus
in
the
Cardiothoracic
Surgical
Suite
.

This
was
performed
in
this
location
in
case
any
acute
cardiac
decompensation
occurred
during
the
time
of
cesarean
section
.

Cardiothoracic
Surgery
was
on
standby
during
the
surgery
.

The
patient
went
to
the
cardiac
Intensive
Care
Unit
on
the
West
Campus
postoperatively
.

She
did
well
during
the
postoperative
period
.

She
required
several
episodes
of
diuresis
due
to
increasing
shortness
of
breath
on
postoperative
day
#1
and
postoperative
day
#2
due
to
worsening
symptoms
of
shortness
of
breath
from
fluid
shifts
that
normally
occur
during
the
postpartum
period
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
West
Campus
on
postoperative
day
#2
in
stable
condition
.

She
did
well
during
the
remainder
of
her
postoperative
course
and
was
continued
on
her
medication
regimen
that
she
had
been
on
during
the
antepartum
period
.

She
was
discharged
to
home
on
postoperative
day
#4
.

She
was
to
followup
with
Maternal
Fetal
Medicine
in
5
to
7
days
.

She
had
followup
with
her
primary
cardiologist
in

Rehab
Hospital
scheduled
for

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
seventy
two
year
old
man
who
a
number
of
years
ago
underwent
coronary
bypass
surgery
at
another
institution
.

This
took
place
in
1983
.

In
1992
he
underwent
redo

replacement
.

In
April
1994
he
presented

an
acute
inferior
myocardial
infarction
and
was
given
Streptokinase
.

He
had
recurrent
pain
and
went
to
the
Catheter
Laboratory
where
a
proximal
right
coronary
artery
lesion
was
angioplastied
.

A
relook
several
days
later
led
to
a
repeat
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
.

He
has
has
stable
,
mild
angina
,
subsequently
,
mostly
in
the
setting
of
stress
.

Slightly

recent
months
.

On
the
day
of
admission
,
he
was
involved
in
a
minor
motor
vehicle
accident
,
and
there
was
some
apparent
controversy
with
the
driver
of
the
other
vehicle
,
during
the
course
of
which
he
developed
substernal
chest
pain
radiating
to
the
left
arm
and
shoulder
.

This
waxed
and
waned
for
thirty
to
sixty
minutes
,
and
he
took
a
number
of
nitroglycerins
.

After
returning
home
after
conferring
with
his
wife
,
and
the
pain
lasted
another
half
hour
,
he
came
to
the
emergency
room
.

His
electrocardiogram
showed
increased
T
wave
inversions
in
V3
and
V4
and
1
mm
.

ST
segment
depression
in
V3
through
V6
.

His
examination
was
largely
benign
after
he
was
made
pain
free
.

The
pulse
was
75
,
blood
pressure
120/80
,
respirations
18
,
and
he
was
afebrile
.

The
jugular
veins
were
not
distended
,
the
carotid
volume
was
diminished
.

The
chest
was
clear
and
the
cardiac
rhythm
was
regular
.

There
were
normal
prothetic
valves
.

There
was
a
grade
II-II
apical
and
systolic
murmur
.

The
abdomen
was
negative
and
there
was
no
edema
of
the
feet
.

The
electrocardiogram
demonstrated
normal
sinus
rhythm
with
poor
R
wave
progression
,
left
atrial
enlargement
and

.

She
received
postoperative
chemotherapy
.

In
September
of
1992
,
she
underwent
an
exploratory
laparotomy
because
of
an
increased
level
of
CEA
in
her
blood
with
the
presence
of
a
liver
abnormality
on
computerized
tomography
scan
.

The
exploratory
laparotomy
was
negative
.

She
continued
to
have
a
rise
in
her
CEA
level
which
prompted
a
further
work
up
.

In
September
of
1993
,
an
abdominal
and
pelvic
computerized
tomography
scan
was
negative
and
in
June
of
1993
,
she
had
a
negative
bone
scan
.

In
December
of
1994
,
a
thoracic
computerized
tomography
scan
showed
a
four
centimeter
soft
tissue
mass
on
the
left
suprahilar
region
,
adjacent
to
the
aortopulmonary
window
.

She
also
experienced
increased
hoarseness
over
the
preceding
months
,
which
was
due
to
left
vocal
cord
paralysis
.

She
also
complains
of
increased
shortness
of
breath
for
the
preceding
month
and
now
presents
for
mediastinal
exploration
and
resection
of
her
probable
metastatic
mass
.

,
and
the
oropharynx
was

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
.

The
patient
was
brought
to
the
Operating
Room
on
January
3
,
1994
where
she
underwent
a
median
sternotomy
with
removal
of
her
mediastinal
mass
.

This
mass
was
situated
in
the
aortopulmonary
window
and
was
sent
to
pathology
.

The
frozen
section
analysis
revealed
this
to
be
adenocarcinoma
,
metastatic
disease
from
the
colon
most
likely
.

She
had
a
chest
tube
placed
intraoperatively
and
another
placed
postoperatively
in
the
recovery
room
,
for
what
was
presumed
to
be
a
left
pleural
effusion
.

This
tube
drained
only
a
small
amount
of
fluid
and
it
was
likely
that
the
effusion
was
made
to
look
more
severe
in
the
presence
of
left
hemidiaphragm
elevation
.

This
additional
chest
tube
was
removed
the
following
day
.

Her
postoperative
hematocrit
was
31
,
compared
to
a
preoperative
level
of
43
.

Her
postoperative
recovery
was
really
quite
remarkable
.

Mediastinal
chest
tube
was
removed
on
postoperative
day
three
.

The
patient
was
discharged
home
in
stable
condition
on
postoperative
day
six
.

Hospital
Course

:

Pt
admitted
with
E
coli
SPB
and
bacteremia
.

Was
treated
with
ceftriaxone
2
gm
IV
daily
with
multiple
repeat
paracenteses
.

taps
did
not
revealed
evidence
of
infection
.

Patient
was
treated
with
14
days
of
levoflox
.

Resp
failure
:

Unclear
etiology
,
but
likely
aspiration
event
in
Monica
.

Treated
aspiration
pneumonia
.

Weaning
and
potential
extubation
complicated
by
mechanical
disadvantage
from
large
ascites
as
well
as
continued
somnolence
(
off
sedation
).

we
Performed
frequent
large
vol
taps
and
attempted
to
give
diuretics
,
but
were
limited
by
renal
failure
.

The
ascites
quickly
accumulated
after
each
tap
.

Patient
was
not
a
TIPS
candidate
.

Cirrhosis
:

End-stage
cirrhosis
with
refractory
ascites
.

Each
time
we
have
initiated
diuretics
,
creatinine
rose
.

Patient
was
continued
on
nadolol
(
as
bp
tolerated
)
and
lactulose
)

Renal
failure
:

Creatinine
elevation
appears
to
be
related
to
both
elevated
abdominal
pressures
from
ascites
as
well
as
to
attempts
at
diuresis
.

AMS
:

Likely
hepatic
encepholopathy
initially
,
and
later
likely
related
to
sedation
and
delayed
clearance
from
liver
disease
.

Patient
became
increasingly
hypotensive
with
a
rising
cr
,
eventually
becoming
pressor
dependent
.

Family
meeting
was
held
to
discuss
grave
prognosis

History
of
Present
Illness
:

57
yo
right
handed
male
with
seizure
history
since
1988
,
s/p
craniotomies
x
3
(
most
recently
05-05
)
for
oligodendroglioma
.

The
patient
began
having
generalized
tonic
-
clonic
seizures
in
1988
,
which
at
the
time
were
thought
to
be
related
to
asthma
medications
.

At
this
time
,
his
head
CT
was
negative
,
and
he
was
treated
with
Dilantin
and
Phenobarbital
.

However
,
he
continued
to
have
left
arm
focal
motor
seizures
and
problems
thinking
.

In
2001-08-31
he
stopped
his
medication
and
had
a
generalized
tonic
-
clonic
seizure
in
12/94
.

He
was
diagnosed
by
biopsy
with
oligodendroglioma
,
and
gross
total
resection
by
Dr.
Redner
in

95
revealed
a
low-grade
oligodendroglioma
.

He
was
followed
by
Dr.
Gregory
Dumas
,
with
serial
MRI
's.

In
2011-05-02
,
he
was
requiring
more
ativan
to
control
his
seizures
,
and
was
increasingly
disoriented
and
forgetful
with
headaches
.

He
had
a
repeat
total
resection
in
4/04
by
Dr.
Peter
Hoadley
at
Hallmark
Health
System
which
revealed
anaplastic
oligodendroglioma
grade
III
.

He
had
radiation
following
the
resection
and
was
doing
well
on
monthly
Temodar
until
2012-04-23
when
he
had
a
marked
change
in
behavior
,
his
balance
was
off
,
speech
slurred
,
and
he
had
difficulty
using
the
computer
.

A
head
MRI
on
2012-04-24
revealed
increasing
tumor
infiltration
with
increased
edema
and
mass
effect
.

He
underwent
a
right
craniotomy
with
resection
and
gliadel
wafers
on
2012-05-02
at
Hallmark
Health
System
by
Dr.
Ackley
.

Came
for
neurosurgery
follow
up
on
05-21
,
and
had
been
having
clear
fluid
leaking
from
his
incision
,
as
well
as
frontal
headache
,
imbalance
,
bumping
into
things
with
his
left
leg
and
worsening
tremors
.

He
was
admitted
for
Lumbar
drain
placement

Of
Hospital
who
is
admitted
with
dyspnea
and
severe
heart
failure
.

Mr.
Vessels
&apos;s
postoperative
course
has
been
marked
by
CMV
infection
,
hypertension
,
poorly
controlled
lipids
,
peripheral
vascular
disease
,
and
chronic
renal
insufficiency
with
a
creatinine
of
1.8
or
so
.

Recently
he
had
documented
coronary
angiography
based
on
a
catheterization
performed
in
January
1996
with
moderate
to
diffuse
atherosclerosis
.

A
repeat
angiogram
performed
a
year
later
showed
marked
progression
of
coronary
allograft
disease
.

A
biopsy
at
that
time
revealed
grade
1B
rejection
with
endothelialitis
and
eosinophils
.

He
was
treated
with
pulsed
IV
steroids
and
Imuran
,
was
augmented
with
mycophenolate
Mofetil
.

Chest
x-ray
showed
cariogenic
pulmonary
edema
and
he
was
faring
poorly
.

Prior
to
admission
he
was
seen
approximately
1
week
in
the
office
with
mild
congestive
heart
failure
.

An
echocardiogram
then
revealed
an
ejection
fraction
of
40%
and
an
endomyocardial
biopsy
revealed
no
ejection
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
AND
TREATMENT
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
via
the
emergency
room
where
a
bedside
echocardiogram
was
performed
.

The
echocardiogram
revealed
no
pericardial
effusion
,
an
ejection
fraction
of
30%
and
worsening
systolic
dysfunction
.

Hydrocortisone
was
given
1
g
in
an
attempt
to
reverse
what
was
thought
to
be
aggressive
coronary
allograft
vasculopathy
.

The
patient
diuresed
and
responded
to
Lasix
100
mg
administered
in
the
emergency
room
and
was
admitted
to
a
monitored
bed
.

At
4:30
AM
the
following
morning
the
patient
was
found
in
cardiac
arrest
.

Despite
intravenous
fluids
,
intravenous
epinephrine
,
and
multiple
attempts
at
defibrillation
,
the
patient
was
unable
to
be
resuscitated
.

Upon
arrival
of
the
covering
access
physician
the
patient
was
being
ventilated
mechanically
and
CPR
was
being
performed
.

The
rhythm
revealed
sinus
tachycardia
with
no
palpable
or
measurable
blood
pressure
.

There
were
also
runs
of
ventricular
tachycardia
which
generated
into
ventricular
fibrillation
that
was
refractory
to
multiple
cardioversions
.

A
pericardiocentesis
was
attempted
with
no
yield
of
pericardial
fluid
.

A
transvenous
pacing
wire
was
attempted
and
a
pacing
rhythm
was
obtained
but
with
no
palpable
blood
pressure
.

In
total
,
the
patient
was
defibrillated
10
times
,
given
5
courses
of
intravenous
epinephrine
,
one
course
of
intravenous
Atropine
and
intravenous
calcium
x

in
addition
to
an
amp
of
bicarbonate
.

The
resuscitation
efforts
were
discontinued
at
4:15
AM
and
were
begun
at
3:38
AM
.

The
patient
was
pronounced
dead
.

FINAL
DIAGNOSIS
:

Cervical
carcinoma
;
bilateral
ureteral
obstruction
secondary
to
the
cancer
.

Uremia
.

Ileus
.

OPERATION
:

Bilateral
ureteral
stent
placement
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
78-year-old
woman
had
stage
IIIB
carcinoma
of
the
cervix
and
she
has
known
periaortic
and
splenic
metastases
.

She
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
about
18
days
prior
to
her
admission
,
following
a
month
long
stay
.

When
her
cancer
was
diagnosed
,
she
underwent
total
abdominal
hysterectomy
and
bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy
and
pelvic
lymphadenectomy
.

She
had
extensive
disease
of
the
uterus
,
ovarian
tubes
,
omentum
and
the
periaortic
lymph
nodes
.

Postoperatively
,
she
developed
ileus
,
then
finally
she
recovered
and
she
was
discharged
to
the
nursing
home
.

She
was
readmitted
because
of
a
problem
with
uremia
and
high
BUN
and
creatinine
when
she
seen
in
the
office
and
the
BUN
and
creatinine
was
ordered
.

The
BUN
was
70
and
creatinine
was
4.6
and
for
this
reason
she
had
ultrasound
of
the
kidney
which
showed
bilateral
hydronephrosis
.

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
ureteral
stent
placement
.

On
the
day
of
admission
,
she
was
generally
stable
and
she
had
no
evidence
of
disease
in
the
pelvis
,
no
bleeding
and
no
other
abnormality
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Dr.
Jescdrig
was
called
and
a
consultation
was
done
and
he
placed
bilateral
ureteral
stents
in
her
kidneys
.

Postoperatively
,
she
diuresed
very
well
.

She
had
dropped
her
BUN
and
creatinine
to
normal
and
she
was
found
to
have
may
be
metastatic
disease
to
her
skin
on
the
right
paraumbilical
area
.

Because
of
her
age
and
mental
condition
and
the
fact
that
she
had
cerebral
atrophy
,
the
decision
was
made
for
comfort
unless
she
has
any
further
problem
and
no
further
chemotherapy
or
treatment
will
be
given
.

The
possibility
that
she
may
need
to
receive
radiation
therapy
to
this
area
to
prevent
her
from
getting
further
obstruction
was
also
brought
up
.

Her
family
felt
that
at
the
present
time
,
because
her
condition
was
no
good
,
they
would
like
to
just
take
her
home
so
that
she
could
enjoy
the
quality
of
life
.

Indeed
,
at
the
time
of
discharge
she
was
conscious
and
she
was
cooperative
and
she
was
able
to
communicate
very
nicely
with
everyone
including
her
family
,
except
for
the
mental
instability
that
she
had
because
of
her
cerebral
atrophy
due
to
senility
.

FOLLOW-UP
:

She
will
be
followed
in
the
Centu
Fairgmer
Queen
Medical
Center
.

.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
72
year
old
white
male
with
a
history
of
coronary
artery
disease
,
status
post
a
four
vessel
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
in
1983
,
pulmonary
hypertension
,
hepatitis
C
positive
cirrhosis
history
with
history
of
portal
hypertension
and
status
post
an
upper
gastrointestinal
bleed
on
4-10-98
,
who
presents
from
Sondi
Memorial
for
work
up
of
pulmonary
infiltrates
,
acute
renal
failure
and
pulmonary
hypertension
.

The
patient
presented
to
Sondi
Memorial
on
4-10-98
with
fatigue
and
fall
,
found
to
have
a
hematocrit
of
29
,
baseline
37
.

The
patient
was
transfused
two
units
and
an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy
done
where
it
showed
gastritis
,
candidal
esophagitis
and
portal
hypertensive
gastropathy
without
varices
.

A
colonoscopy
showed
anteriordysplasia
,
no
bleeding
was
seen
.

The
patient
was
discharged
after
one
week
on
iron
sulfate
.

On
4-24
,
the
patient
was
seen
again
at
Sondi
Memorial
when
he
experienced
at
home
a
fall
,
no
loss
of
consciousness
,
positive
substernal
chest
pain
,
pleuritic
pain
,
shortness
of
breath
and
cough
.

He
went
to
Sondi
Memorial
where
he
ruled
out
for
myocardial
infarction
and
was
found
to
have
a
left
lower
lobe
infiltrate
/
pneumonia
,
started
on
cefuroxime
.

His
respiratory
condition
continued
to
deteriorate
despite
aggressive
chest
physical
therapy
for
possible
blood
,
given
Lasix
for
congestive
heart
failure
,
became
hypotensive
,
hypoxic
and
intubated
.

The
patient
was
found
to
have
expanding
pulmonary
infiltrates
on
chest
x-ray
,
developed
acute
renal
insufficiency
with
minimal
urine
output
,
less
than
10
cc
an
hour
,
started
on
dopamine
for
hemodynamic
instability
.

An
echocardiogram
was
obtained
on
4-26
which
showed
concentric
left
ventricular
hypertrophy
with
normal
_____
left
ventricular
function
,
severe
right
ventricular
dilatation
with
septal
hypokinesis
and
flattening
with
a
question
of
right
ventricular
apical
clot
raised
with
mild
aortic
stenosis
,
severe
tricuspid
regurgitation
and
increased
pulmonary
artery
pressure
of
approximately
70
millimeters
,
consistent
with
fairly
severe
pulmonary
hypertension
.

Blood
cultures
x
two
sent
off
with
no
growth
.

The
patient
ruled
out
for
myocardial
infarction
with
flat
creatine
kinases
and
he
was
sent
to
Oaksgekesser/
Memorial
Hospital
for
further
work
up
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
AND
TREATMENT
:

At
the
Oaksgekesser/
Memorial
Hospital
he
was
quite
hypotensive
,
requiring
dopamine
at
1,000
,
Levo
at
12
.

His
chest
x-ray
showed
diffuse
patchy
infiltrates
on
left
lung
with
left
upper
lung
patchy
infiltrates
and
right
hemidiaphragm
elevated
,
consistent
with
adult
respiratory
distress
syndrome
from
possible
pneumonia
.

A
urinalysis
was
obtained
which
showed
blood
,
urine
sediment
was
active
with
positive
dysmorphic
cells
,
red
cell
casts
,
and
1+
albumin
with
mild
protein
uria
.

The
patient
had
ANCA
,
anti-GBM
,
anti-streptolycin
,
ANA
,
UPEP
,
SPEP
,
renal
ultrasound
,
hepatitis
C
cryoglobulin
sent
out
.

He
had
a
bronchoscopy
immediately
done
which
showed
no
fresh
blood
,
just
old
clot
and
a
pulmonary
arterial
line
placed
in
the
right
internal
jugular
vein
.

Question
of
pulmonary-renal
syndrome
was
raised
.

The
patient
subsequently
deteriorated
over
time
,
was
started
on
CVVH
and
suffered
significant
complications
without
improvement
of
his
pulmonary
/
renal
situation
.

A
family
meeting
was
held
on
5-2-98
and
it
was
decided
that
the
patient
should
be
made
comfort
care
only
.

All
CVVH
and
the
ventilator
was
removed
and
the
patient
spontaneously
passed
away
on
5-2-98
,
at
4:55
p.m.

Family
and
primary
carephysician

PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
is
a
56
year-old
gentleman

severe
aortic
stenosis
,
reports
having
been
told
he
had
a
heart
murmur
many
years

.

He
has
had
mild
dyspnea
on
exertion
increasing
over
the
past
couple
of
months
prior
to
admission
.

An
echocardiogram
in

q
A.M.
and
8
to
16
in
the
evening
depending
upon
where
his
blood
sugar
has
been
.

Preoperative
laboratory
values
were
unremarkable
.

The
patient
underwent
cardiac
catheterization
on
2011-10-17
which
revealed
a
20%
left
vein
osteal
lesion
as
well
as
70%
LAD
lesion
and
an
80%
right
coronary
.

The
patient
was
taken
to
the
operating
room
on
2011-10-18
where
he
underwent
an
aortic
valve
replacement
with
#23
mm
pericardial
valve
as
well
as
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
times
two
with
a
LIMA
to
the
LAD
and
saphenous
vein
to
the
acute
marginal
.

Postoperatively
the
patient
was
transported
to
the
cardiac
surgery
recovery
unit
on
Milrinone
,
Neo-Synephrine
and
Levophed
drip
.

The
patient
was
weaned
from
mechanical
ventilation
and
subsequently
extubated
on
the
night
of
surgery
.

He
remained
on
Levophed
,
Milrinone
and
Neo-Synephrine
drips
and
was
hemodynamically
stable
.

N.
Saez
clinic
consult
was
obtained
due
to
hyperglycemia
and
the
need
for
insulin
drip
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

On
postoperative
day
the
Milrinone
was
weaned
down
.

The
Levophed
had
been
discontinued
as
the
Neo-Synephrine
and
the
patient
was
beginning
to
progress
hemodynamically
.

Upon
discontinuation
of
the
Milrinone
the
patient
's
SV02
had
dropped
significantly
in
the
low
50
s.

The
patient
had
decreased
exercise
tolerance
and
therefore
was
placed
back
on
his
milrinone
to
keep
his
cardiac
index
greater
than
2.0
.

Over
the
next
couple
of
days
it
was
very
slowly
decreased
as
his
Ace
inhibitors
were
increased
orally
.

The
patient
ultimately
was
weaned
off
the
Milrinone
,
transitioned
to
Captopril
on
postoperative
day
five
and
remained
hemodynamically
stable
.

Once
the
patient
had
remained
off
of
inotropics
for
approximately
24
hours
,
he
had
been
given
diuretics
and
Ace
inhibitors
and
remained
hemodynamically
stable
he
was
transferred
from
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
to
the
Telemetry
floor
on
postoperative
day
six
.

A
physical
therapy
evaluation
was
obtained
for
assistance
and
mobility
.

Cardiac
rehabilitation
was
initiated
at
that
time
.

On
2011-10-24
postoperative
day
six
consultation
heart
failure
cardiology
service
was
obtained
.

It
was
their
recommendation
to
continue
Ace
inhibitors
,
to
continue
daily
weights
,
to
switch
the
patient
to
a
long
acting
beta-blocker
and
to
enroll
the
patient
in
postoperative
cardiac
rehabilitation
as
well
as
to
make
sure
the
patient
was
on
statin
drugs
.

These
measures
were
all
instituted
.

The
patient
continued
to
progress
from
cardiac
rehabilitation
and
physical
therapy
standpoint
while
on
the
floor
.

The
patient
remained
hemodynamically
stable
over
the
next
few
days
,
continued
to
increase
with
physical
therapy
and
ambulation
.

His
blood
sugars
were
followed
by
the
Cape
Cod
Hospital
Clinic
service
and
insulin
has
been
adjusted
accordingly
.

Today
,
2011-10-31
,
postoperative
day
13
the
patient
remains
stable
and
ready
for

white
male
with
acute
inferior
myocardial
infarction
,
who
was
urgently
transferred
by
Dr.
Lenni
Factor
for
cardiac
catheterization
and
possible
angioplasty
.

His
only

,
1999
at
6
AM
the
patient
was
admitted
to
No
Verlmerver

inferior
myocardial
infarction
.

Due
to
unknown
duration
of
the
chest
pain
the
patient
wastransferred
urgently
to
the
TGCHO
for
cardiac
catheterization
.

Shortly
after

HOSPITAL
COURSE
AND
TREATMENT
:

The
patient
was
directly
admitted
to
the
cardiac
catheterization
laboratory
.

Coronary
angiography
,
right
heart
catheterization
and
percutaneous
intervention
of
the
RCA
were
performed
from
the
right
groin
without
complications
.

The
proximal
RCA
was
totally
occluded
with
good
left
to
right
collaterals
.

The
LAD
showed
a
40%
stenosis
in
the
proximal
segment
.

The
circumflex
showed
mild
atherosclerotic
.

The
RCA
occlusion
was
successfully
dilated
and
sent
using
a
3.0
X
23
mm
Duet
with
post
stent
dilatation
up
to
16
atmospheres
.

Following
intervention
right
heart
catheterization
was
performed
to
rule
out
RV
infarct
.

The
RA
was
5
.

PA
was
19/7
with
a
mean
of
13
.

PCW
was
11
.

Of
note
there
was
a
clear
A
wave
in
the
RV
tracing
,
suggestive
of
RV
infarct
.

The
next
day
the
patient
was
quite
confused
and
disoriented
,
which
gradually
disappeared
.

An
echocardiogram
was
performed
to
evaluate
the
LV
function
,
which
showed
an
ejection
fraction
of
53%
with
inferoposteriorakinesis
/
hypokinesis
.

The
next
day
the
patient
&apos;s
mental
status
came
back
to
baseline
and
he
remained
free
of
angina
.

.

He
was
sent
home
with
a
PICC
line
and
IV
antibiotics
.

He
returned
to
the
Wing
Memorial

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

1)
Respiratory
failure
:

On
admission
,
this
was
felt
to
be
likely
03-15
worsening
PNA
.

Pt
remained
intubated
until
2017-02-14
.

He
had
difficulty
weaning
from
the
vent
due
to
difficulties
with
neurological
status
(
he
remained
drowsy
and
unresponsive
for
many
days
)
but
eventually
awoke
enough
and
was
extubated
without
difficulty
and
remained
stable
on
3L
NC
.

He
was
transferred
to
the
floor
but
a
few
days
later
began
to
show
signs
of
respiratory
distress
and
was
transferred
back
to
the
CMED
CSRU
for
reintubation
for
likely
aspiration
event
leading
to
worsening
pneumonia
as
well
as
some
component
of
pulm
edema
.

He
was
extubated
a
few
days
later
and
transferred
back
to
the
floor
where
his
pulm
status
improved
dramatically
with
lasix
and
continued
nebulizer
treatments
.

The
patient
was
prepared
for
discharge
on
05-29
,
when
he
was
sat
'
ing
in
the
high
90
's
on
room
air
.

However
,
on
2017-03-01
at
6
am
the
pt
was
found
with
labored
respirations
(
rr
=
24
)
and
SaO2
89%
,
which
improved
to
only
SaO290
-
91%
on
100%
NRB
.

ABG
(
7.42
/
38
/
88
)
was
performed
,
80
mg
lasix
was
given
and
the
patietn
had
foley
placed
and
had
good
urine
output
and
good
mentation
.

He
was
also
given
nebulizers
without
improvement
.

His
chest
radiograph
had
fluffy
bilateral
infiltrates
.

Although
the
pt
was
w/o
fever
,
he
had
chills
.

He
was
readmitted
tot
he
CMED
CSRU
for
respiratory
distress
likely
secondary
to
a
recurrent
aspiration
event
.

He
was
continued
on
meropenem
,
started
on
BiPAP
and
aggressively
suctioned
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
intubation
.

On
03-02
at
10
am
,
the
patient
had
an
acutechange
in
mental
status
with
bradycardia
,
hypertension
,
pinpoint
pupils
,
decerebrate
posturing
and
increased
tone
in
bilateral
upper
extremities
and
unresponsiveness
.

The
patient
was
brought
to
CT
immediately
for
stat
scan
and
was
found
to
have
a
massive
occipital
spontaneous
hemorrhage
into
the
L
ventricle
requiring
ventricular
drainage
.

Neurosurgery
was
immediately
called
for
an
EVD
and
anesthesia
was
called
STAT
to
the
bedside
for
intubation
at
10:45
am
in
order
to
assist
in
hyperventilation
.

After
endotracheal
intubation
,
MAPs
were
maintained
between
70
and
90
,
dilantin
was
dose
to
maintain
an
appropriate
level
.

L
frontal
ICP
bolt
was
placed
by
neurosurgery
under
sterile
conditions
on
antibiotics
.

Mannitol
75
mg
iv
x
1
then
50
gm
iv
tid
was
begun
to
maintain
serum
osm
>
320
and
Na
>
147
.

The
patient
was
hyperventilated
to
goal
PCO2
30-35
with
ICP
improvement
.

Serial
head
CT
studies
and
neurologic
exams
were
performed
but
the
patient
was
unchaged
,
unresponsive
with
posturing
and
no
spontaneous
movement
despite
ICP
being
maintained
in
good
range
(
<
20
).

On
2017-03-03
,
a
family
meeting
resulted
in
the
patient
's
code
being
changed
to
comfort
measures
only
.

The
patient
was
terminally
extubated
on
a
morphine
drip
and
ativan
titrated
for
agonal
breathing
and
discomfort
;
scopolamine
was
used
as
an
adjunct
to
control
secretions
and
appeared
comfortable
when
he
died
at
12:27
pm
on
2017-03-04
.

The
family
refused
autopsy
or
post-mortem
examination
to
deduce
secondary
causes
of
death
.

2.
ID
-
Bacteremia
and
PNA
:

Pt
's
triple
lumen
catheter
was
found
to
be

(
for
course
of
6
weeks
)
and
meropenem
was
added
on
02-09
(
for
3
week
course
).

TEE
was

from
this
medication
.

On
this
admission
he
was
continued
on
prednisone
taper
.

Fluoroquinolones
and
other
renal
toxins
were
avoided
.

Renal
function
gradually
improved
and
Cr
trended
down
from
peak
of
7.6
to
1.4
.

Before
the
patient
acutely
decompensated
as
above
,
the
plan
was
for
steroid
taper
:

60
mg
x
10
days
(
already
completed
)
,
40
mg
x
14
d
(
already
completed
)
,
20
mg
x
14
d
(
now
day
11-24
)
,
10
mg
x
10
d
,
5
mg
x
10
d
.

4)
Foot
ulcer
:
The
pt
was
followed
by
podiatry
and
had
several
further
debridement
of
his
R
heel
wound
.

on
abx
,
podiatry
following
,
changed
vac
q3
days
.

5)
Encephalopathy
:
It
was
unclear
why
the
pt
's
mental
status
initially
did
not
improve
more
quickly
after
all
sedatives
were
removed
and
he
was
extubated
.

His
MS
waxed
and
waned
for
many
days
and
uremia
vs.
failure
to
clear
sedatives
were
considered
(
although
pt
was
making
urine
and
LFT
's
are
wnl
).

The
pt
had
an
EEG
and
2
head
CT
's
which
did
not
show
anoxic
brain
injury
or
bleeding
.

He
gradually
improved
and
was
A&Ox3
and
near
baseline
before
Amesbury
Hospital
transferred
to
the
CMED
CSRU
in
respiratory
distress
.

6)
DM
:

Pt
was
maintained
on
SSI
with
small
amount
of
standing
insulin
while
he
was
NPO
and
then
his
dose
was
gradually
increased
as
he
received
tube
feeds
.

7)
FEN
:

The
pt
had
an
NG
tube
placed
and
received
tube
feeds
for
the
majority
of
his
hospitalization
.

Upon
extubation
and
transfer
to
the
floor
he
pulled
out
the
NG
tube
time
several
times
and
required
restraints
.

Albumin
was
very
low
and
pt
had
significant
edema
likely
03-15
this
.

A
few
days
before
decompensating
,
his
mental
status
improved
to
the
degree
that
he
was
able
to
eat
normal
food
without
aspirating
.

8)
CV
:

Pump
/
HTN
:
pt
had
episodes
of
both
hypertension
and
hypotension
during
his
stay
.

He
was
managed
with
Metoprolol
,
Hydralazine
,
and
Amlodipine
.

Near
discharge
his
BP
was
controlled
with
Metoprolol
only
.

9)
Hypernatremia
-
While
in
the
CMED
CSRU
the
pt
developed
hypernatremia
.

This
was
felt
to
be
likely
03-15
intravascular
volume
depletion
since
the
pt
's
albumin
was
so
low
and
he
was
third
spacing
all
of
his
fluid
.

He
was
volume
resuscitated
and
managed
with
D5W
and
lasix
as
well
as
receving
FW
boluses
with
his
NG
tube
feeds
.

The
hypernatremia
fully
resolved
when
he
resumed
eating
on
his
own
and
had
access
to
free
water
.

10)
Anemia
:

Pt
's
Hct
trended
down
slowly
throughout
his
hospitalization
.

Labs
were
consistent
with
anemia
of
chronic
disease
.

He
was
transfused
3
units
pRBC
's
near
the
end
of
his
hospitalization
and
had
an
appropriate
bump
.

11)
CMED
CCU
:

When
the
pt
's
MS
improved
to
near
baseline
before
again
decompensating
,
he
became
extremely
tearful
and
expressed
feelings
of
depression
after
being
in
the
hospital
for
so
long
.

He
expressed
interest
in
taking
an
anti-depressant
for
a
short
time
while
he
was
recovering
and
was
started
on
Celexa
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Mr.
State
is
an
81-year-old
man
with
a
history
of
restrictive
and
obstructive
lung
disease
,
dilated
cardiomyopathy
,
inferior
myocardial
infarction
,
and
anterior
mediastinal
masses
admitted
with
acute
onset
of
pulmonary
edema
.

In
the
setting
of
inadvertently
decreasing
Lasix
from
80
mg.
po
40
mg.
a
day
Mr.
State
had
sudden
onset
dyspnea
after
approximate
day
and
a
half
prodrome
culminating
in
severe
dyspnea
.

Upon
arrival
in
the
Emergency
Room
Mr.
State
&apos;s
saturations
were
in
the
mid
80s
and
he
was
promptly
rendered
more
comfortable
with
high
flow
oxygen
,
morphine
,
and
nitrates
and
intravenous
Lasix
.

Chest
x-ray
was
relatively
unrevealing
for
interstitial
or
alveolar
edema
and
with
clinical
improvement
ensued
with
the
immediate
therapy
in
the
Emergency
Room
as
noted
.

The
patient
denied
angina
,
syncope
,
preceding
worsening
orthopnea
,
paroxysmal
nocturnal
dyspnea
,
palpitations
,
chest
pain
,
hematemesis
or
melena
.

PAST
MEDICAL
HISTORY
:

Is
notable
for
an
inferior
myocardial
infarction
,
restrictive
and
obstructive
lung
disease
with
an
FEV1
of
.9
and
FVC
of
1.34
and
a
moderate
at
best
response
to
bronchodilators
,
and
a
negative
sestamibi
scan
in
May
,
1999
apart
from
a
severe
fixed
inferolateral
defect
,
systolic
dysfunction
with
recent
echocardiography
revealing
an
LVID
of
62
mm.
and
ejection
fraction
of
28
percent
,
moderate
mitral
regurgitation
and
mild-to-moderate
aortic
stenosis
with
a
peak
gradient
of
33
and
a
mean
gradient
of
19
and
a
valve
area
of
1.4
cm.
squared
.

In
addition
,
Mr.
State
has
an
anterior
mediastinal
mass
2x2x1.7
cm.
by
recent
computerized
tomography
scan
without
surrounding
or
adjacent
adenopathy
or
parenchymal
lung
disease
apart
from
bronchiectasis
.

His
cardiomyopathy
work
up
entailed
a
negative
ANA
,
negative
SPEP
,
UPEP
and
Benz-Jones
proteins
,
normal
ferritin
,
thyroid
stimulating
hormone
and
a
recent
work
up
for
possible
bimomatous
associated
myasthenia
gravis
that
was
negative
.

The
patient
lives
on
Quelene
with
his
wife
.

He
is
a
non-smoker
and
drinks
rare
alcohol
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

The
patient
was
a
very
pleasant
man
who
appeared
his
stated
age
.

Blood
pressure
was
155/60
,
heart
rate
70
with
occasional
premature
ventricular
contractions
,
respirations
14
.

Mr.
State
was
dyspneic
speaking
in
short
sentences
initially
on
high
flow
oxygen
.

Jugular
venous
pressure
was
8
with
a
brisk
inspiratory
descent
.

There
was
no
thyromegaly
.

Carotids
were
2+
.

Breath
sounds
were
decreased
at
the
bases
only
with
distant
heart
sounds
and
a
2
out
of
6
systolic
ejection
murmur
consistent
with
aortic
stenosis
with
Gallavardin
like
radiation
to
the
apex
.

Abdomen
:

soft
,
nontender
with
hepatosplenomegaly
,
or
hepatojugular
reflex
,
bruits
or
pulsations
.

There
was
no
rash
and
no
edema
and
the
neurological
examination
was
non-focal
.

LABORATORY
DATA
:

Notable
for
a
sodium
of
145
,
potassium
3.6
,
BUN
23
,
creatinine
1.3
,
glucose
104
,
hematocrit
42
,
white
count
8.7
,
platelet
count
235
and
a
PT
of
12.9
seconds
.

The
urinalysis
was
negative
.

The
Troponin
I
was
less
than
.4
and
the
creatine
kinase
was
114
.

Chest
x-ray
revealed
moderate
cardiomegaly
with
no
clear
interstitial
or
alveolar
pulmonary
edema
and
chronic
atelectasis
and
/
or
scarring
at
both
lung
bases
.

The
electrocardiogram
revealed
normal
sinus
rhythm
with
premature
atrial
complexes
and
right
bundle
branch
block
with
left
anterior
hemiblock
and
old
anterior
myocardial
infarction
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Hospital
and
underwent
an
approximate
1.5
liter
diuresis
within
the
first
24
hours
with
improvement
in
his
symptoms
and
improvement
in
his
oxygen
saturations
.

After
a
long
discussion
with
the
patient
and
his
family
it
was
determined
that
a
cardiac
catheterization
would
be
prudent
.

Prior
to
catheterization
a
VQ
scan
was
performed
which
revealed
a
moderate
probability
for
PE
with
a
subsegmental
defect
in
the
lingular
on
the
left
lung
.

Subsequent
lower
extremities
noninvasive
studies
and
D-dimer
test
were
both
negative
rendering
the
probability
of
acute
pulmonary
embolism
less
than
2
percent
.

It
was
not
felt
that
the
patient
would
be
in
need
of
chronic
Coumadin
therapy
in
lieu
of
this
low
probability
findings
in
toto
.

Coronary
angiography
revealed
occlusion
of
the
right
coronary
artery
proximally
with
insignificant
plaquing
in
the
left
anterior
descending
artery
and
circumflex
arteries
.

After
a
approximate
3
liter
total
diuresis
the
right
atrial
pressure
was
5
,
pulmonary
capillary
wedge
pressure
14
,
pulmonary
vacuolar
resistance
353
and
the
cardiac
output
depressed
at
2.95
liters
per
minute
,
or
a
cardiac
index
of
1.7
liters
per
minute
.

Based
upon
these
findings
it
was
felt
that
Mr.
State
most
likely
has
multi-factorial
dyspnea
owing
to
both
his
ventilatory
limitation
and
to
a
chronic
low
output
state
.

In
Hospital
he
was
seen
by
both
Speech
Therapy
,
physical
therapy
,
and
the
Uspend
Harmemewood
Medical
Center
Congestive
Heart
Failure
Nurse
Practitioner
Program
.

His
Isordil
was
increased
in
Hospital
and
blood
pressure
control
was
relative
episodic
with
systolic
pressures
ranging
between
100
and
160
.

Future
adjustments
will
be
made
at
home
pending
his
blood
pressure
measures
.

At
a
goal
weight
of
142
pounds
,
Mr.
State
&apos;s
filling
pressures
appeared
ideal
with
a
wedge
pressure
of
14
and
his
goal
weight
range
will
be
between
142
and
44
pounds
at
home
.

The
patient
will
be
followed
by
Dr.
State
within
a
week
of
discharge
and
by
Nieie
Naebrand
Freierm
of
the
Dyathenslycha
Medical
Center

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1.
Congestive
heart
failure
:

Patient
was
diuresed
effectively
with
nesiritide
and
Lasix
.

Patient
's
weight
on
admission
was
250
pounds
,
and
on
the
day
of
discharge
was
244
pounds
which
was
back
to
her
dry
weight
.

She
had
lost
the
6
pounds
that
she
reported
gaining
in
the
four
days
prior
to
her
hospitalization
.

Patient
was
continued
on
her
Toprol
,
her
lisinopril
,
and
her
digoxin
.

Patient
's
Coumadin
was
held
for
right
heart
catheterization
and
biopsy
,
and
then
EP
study
with
ICD
placement
.

Patient
did
have
Woodrow
Betty
,
SPEP
,
and
anticardiolipin
antibody
sent
for
further
workup
of
the
etiology
of
her
cardiomyopathy
.

The
Courtney
,
SPEP
,
and
anticardiolipin
antibody
were
all
negative
.

Her
CKs
did
trend
down
over
the
course
of
her
hospital
stay
,
and
in
the
setting
of
her
known
clean
coronaries
on
cardiac
catheterization
in
2011-11-19
,
it
was
believed
that
a
myocarditis
might
be
the
cause
of
her
elevated
cardiac
enzymes
and
also
could
have
exacerbated
her
congestive
heart
failure
.

Patient
did
receive
a
right
heart
catheterization
,
which
showed
elevated
wedge
pressures
and
biopsy
specimens
were
obtained
of
the
right
ventricle
.

The
results
of
these
biopsies
are
still
pending
in
pathology
.

Post
right
heart
catheterization
and
right
ventricular
biopsy
,
the
patient
was
sent
to
the
CCU
for
a
Swan
-
guided
therapy
in
the
setting
of
her
elevated
wedge
pressures
and
low
cardiac
output
.

In
the
CCU
,
she
was
put
on
milrinone
with
good
results
.

Patient
was
also
seen
by
the
Pulmonary
service
here
and
had
pulmonary
function
tests
done
as
part
of
a
pretransplant
workup
.

There
is
no
pulmonary
process
to
exclude
her
from
the
transplant
list
as
noted
by
the
Pulmonary
service
.

Patient
did
receive
an
ICD
during
this
hospital
admission
without
complication
.

Patient
was
in
bigeminy
during
the
course
of
her
hospital
stay
,
and
did
have
frequent
runs
of
ectopy
as
noted
on
telemetry
.

2.
Her
right
lower
lobe
infiltrate
:

Patient
did
report
a
cough
productive
of
green
sputum
on
admission
.

She
received
a
full
course
of
azithromycin
for
this
with
resolution
of
her
cough
and
sputum
production
.

On
discharge
,
the
patient
was
restarted
on
her
Coumadin
,
which
was
held
for
her
right
heart
catheterization
,
and
her
biopsy
,
and
her
ICD
placement
.

She
was
also
continued
on
all
her
heart
failure
medications
including
her
Toprol
,
her
lisinopril
,
her
digoxin
,
and
her
Lasix
.

months
,
for
which
he
has

says
that
on

PTA
,
when
she
visited
the

at
the

,
he
was
"
having

IMPRESSION
:

Focal
consolidation
in
the
medial
aspect
of
the
right
lower
lung

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

This
86
yo
man
with
h/o
CVA
,
CHF
,
recent
episodes
of
aspiration
pneumonia
,
presented
with
dyspnea
from
his
NH
,
likely
from
new
RLL
pneumonia
.

He
was
started
on
Zosyn
and
Vanco
for
his
presumed
aspiration
,
"
hospital
"
aquired
PNA
.

PE
was
considered
but
less
likely
given
his
fevers
and
clear
pneumonia
on
CXR
.

He
was
supported
on
BIPAP
for
his
respiratory
status
.

An
ABG
was
attempted
in
the
Deanna
however
it
was
limited
by
pt
discomfort
.

ABG
on
arrival
to
the
ICU
was
7.29/56/75
.

He
was
continued
on
BIPAP
.

Blood
cultures
and
sputum
cultures
were
sent
.

Over
the
course
of
the
day
he
continued
to
decline
.

He
was
given
some
prn
Morphine
for
comfort
.

In
the
evening
of
the
day
of
admission
he
was
noted
to
be
increasingly
somnolent
.

A
repeat
ABG
was
performed
which
was
7.03/129/148
.

His
family
was
notified
that
he
was
doing
worse
and
came
in
to
visit
him
.

It
was
his
family
's
wish
that
he
be
made
comfortable
.

Based
upon
this
wish
the
BIPAP
was
removed
and
he
was
placed
on
nasal
cannula
.

He
was
written
for
a
morphine
drip
however
he
expired
before
this
could
be
initiated
.

Secondary
issues

Elevated
lactate
:

This
was
concerning
for
early
sepsis
given
RLL
PNA
.

His
blood
pressures
remained
elevated
and
he
was
hydrated
with
NS
conservatively
,
given
h/o
CHF
and
dyspnea
.

DM2
:

He
was
covered
with
a
Insulin
drip
while
unstable

CV
:

CAD
:

He
was
not
taking
any
PO
medications
per
Hunt

.

Diffuse
adenopathy
was
noted
at
that
time
and
an
attempt
was
made
at
axillary

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
is
a
64-year-old
female
with
a
history
of
hypertension
,
hypercholesterolemia
,
diabetes
mellitus
,
and
dilated
cardiomyopathy
(
with
a
transthoracic
echocardiogram
in
2016-01-13
showing
an
ejection
fraction
of
40%
,
posterior
and
inferior
apical
akinesis
,
and
large
left
ventricular
thrombus
).

The
patient
was
admitted
from
2016-01-21
to
2016-02-03
;
at
which
time
she
was
ruled
out
for
a
myocardial
infarction
.

She
had
a
cardiac
catheterization
which
revealed
3-vessel
disease
with
normal
left
main
,
mid
left
anterior
descending
artery
60%
,
diffuse
90%
mid
distal
stenosis
at
the
origin
of
the
diagonal
,
serial
70%
and
90%
left
circumflex
lesions
,
and
90%
first
obtuse
marginal
,
and
mid
right
coronary
artery
60%
.

During
initial
evaluation
for
a
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
,
80%
to
90%
of
the
right
coronary
artery
stenosis
was
found
;
for
which
she
underwent
a
right
internal
carotid
artery
stent
.

She
was
discharged
on
Coumadin
for
a
goal
INR
of
2.5
to
3
.

She
was
then
admitted
again
on
2016-03-30
for
an
elective
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
.

At
surgery
,
the
descending
aorta
was
noted
to
be
calcified
,
and
an
intraoperative
transesophageal
echocardiogram
revealed
an
irregular
intra-aortic
pedunculated
lesion
.

Given
the
elevated
stroke
risk
of
aortic
cross-clamping
in
the
setting
of
this
finding
,
the
plan
for
a
bypass
graft
was
aborted
.

The
patient
was
then
transferred
to
the
Coronary
Care
Unit
Service
for
medical
management
in
anticipation
of
possible
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
later
in
the
admission
.

.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
is
a
64-year-old
female
with
3-vessel
disease
who
was
admitted
to
the
Coronary
Care
Unit
Service
for
Western
Mass
.

Hospital
medical
optimization
and
management
following
an
aborted
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
when
a
mobile
aortic
atheroma
was
noted
.

The
patient
was
continued
on
aspirin
,
Plavix
,
and
statin
.

Once
the
patient
was
titrated
off
dopamine
,
the
beta
blocker
and
ACE
inhibitor
were
restarted
.

With
regard
to
the
left
ventricular
thrombus
,
her
goal
INR
remained
2.5
to
3
;
and
the
goal
was
to
start
heparin
once
the
patient
was
stable
from
a
thoracotomy
and
chest
tube

standpoint
.

The
patient
remained
comfortable
.

By
04-01
,
on
postoperative
day
two
,
the
patient
was
doing
well
and
the
chest
tube
was
discontinued
.

The
patient
still
had
transcutaneous
pacing
wires
in
place
.

Likewise
,
on
04-01
,
the
patient
was
weaned
off
surgery
without
difficulty
.

Thus
,
the
beta
blocker
and
ACE
inhibitor
were
started
to
be
titrated
up
.

In
addition
,
the
patient
was
started
on
Wellbutrin
for
smoking
cessation
.

At
this
point
,
it
was
determined
that
the
patient
would
not
receive
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
on
this
admission
and
would
likely
be
discharged
to
the
floor
for
stabilization
with
followup
.

The
patient
did
well
and
was
transferred
to
the
floor
on
04-02
.

After
evaluation
and
a
discussion
with
Dr.
Gunter
,
it
was
determined
that
the
patient
no
longer
needed
anticoagulation
since
there
was
no
aortic
thrombus
but
only
an
aortic
plaque
,
and
there
was
no
anterior/apical
akinesis
noted
.

At
this
point
,
the
left
ventricular
thrombus
(
for
which
she
was
initially
started
therapy
for
)
was
no
longer
present
.

The
patient
was
noted
to
have
a
slight
hematocrit
drop
and
was
transfused
one
unit
of
packed
red
blood
cells
for
a
goal
hematocrit
of
greater
than
30
.

By
04-03
,
captopril
and
atenolol
were
started
,
and
the
patient
's
leg
bandage
from
the
vein
harvest
was
removed
.

The
patient
continued
to
do
well
on
the
medical
regimen
and
was
without
chest
pain
,
shortness
of
breath
,
or
any
other
symptoms
.

DISCHARGE
DISPOSITION
:

Thus
,
the
patient
was
discharged
to
home
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
74
year
old
female
with
metastatic
papillary
carcinoma
of
the
thyroid
who
presented
to
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
on
4/28/93
with
progressive
weakness
,
weight
loss
and
shortness
of
breath
.

The
patient
was
in
a
good
state
of
health
until
January
of
1993
when
she
developed
a
serious
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
associated
with
weakness
and
fatigue
.

She
had
also
reported
a
weight
loss
of
15
pounds
over
the
past
two
months
.

Although
her
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
seemed
to
be
resolving
,
her
weakness
persisted
.

A
work
up
begun
by
her
internist
,
Dr.
Brain
,
revealed
a
white
blood
cell
count
of
49,000
with
50%
eosinophils
.

She
was
admitted
to
Box
Memorial
Hospital
Nursing
Home
for
further
evaluation
.

Data
collected
there
included
a
chest
x-ray
which
was
unremarkable
.

The
liver
function
tests
showed
an
alkaline
phosphatase
of
303
,
LDH
310
,
SGOT
66
,
albumin
2.5
.

A
peripheral
blood
smear
showed
mature
eosinophils
in
increased
numbers
.

Chromosomal
studies
were
negative
.

A
bone
scan
showed
increased
uptake
at
the
manubrium
at
the
site
of
an
old
fracture
,
as
well
as
in
the
right
supraclavicular
area
.

A
thyroid
ultrasound
showed
an
inferior
thyroid
mass
.

This
was
followed
by
an
abdominal
CT
which
showed
an
enlarged
spleen
,
a
lytic
lesion
on
the
right
iliac
bone
and
a
benign
renal
cyst
.

Biopsy
of
the
lytic
lesion
was
consistent
with
metastases
papillary
carcinoma
of
the
thyroid
.

An
upper
gastrointestinal
was
unremarkable
.

The
small
bowel
follow
through
was
within
normal
limits
.

A
thyroid
scan
revealed
decreased
function
and
displacement
of
the
thyroid
by
a
cold
mass
located
inferiorly
with
calcifications
on
the
right
side
.

A
chest
CT
also
revealed
a
small
pulmonary
nodule
with
a
necrotic
mass
involving
the
right
lung
posteriorly
.

The
patient
was
subsequently
referred
to
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
under
the
service
of
Dr.
Brain
.

She
continued
to
have
profound
weakness
,
a
decreased
appetite
and
weight
loss
.

She
also
developed
lower
extremity
edema
as
well
as
left
upper
extremity
swelling
associated
with
increased
shortness
of
breath
on
exertion
.

A
needle
biopsy
of
the
right
thyroid
nodule
showed
papillary
thyroid
carcinoma
.

The
patient
reports
no
history
of
radiation
exposure
,
no
family
history
of
thyroid
carcinoma
,
no
recent
travels
or
exposure
to
tuberculosis
.

PAST

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
Dr.
Shatermivaet
S
Brain
on
4/28/93
with
a
history
of
papillary
carcinoma
of
the
thyroid
with
bone
involvement
and
possible
lung
involvement
.

Work
up
was
begun
for
the
possible
myeloproliferative
/
myelodysplastic
disorder
associated
with
the
hyper-eosinophilic
syndrome
.

Accordingly
,
an
Oncology
consult
was
called
on
4/29/93
and
a
bone
marrow
aspirate
biopsy
was
performed
.

This
revealed
maturation
of
leukocytes
to
all
stages
with
markedly
increased
eosinophilic
proliferation
.

A
lung
biopsy
was
performed
on
4/30/93
without
definitive
results
.

During
this
time
the
patient
&apos;s
coagulation
status
had
improved
with
Vitamin
K
therapy
with
PTs
normalizing
.

ANCA
serum
results
were
negative
.

ANA
results
were
also
nonsuggestive
.

The
patient
continued
to
suffer
from
edema
of
the
left
upper
extremity
and
a
Vascular
Radiology
consult
revealed
a
thrombosis
of
the
left
subclavian
vein
extending
into
the
axillary
vein
.

There
was
some
thrombosis
of
the
left
internal
jugular
vein
as
well
.

A
head
CT
was
performed
and
was
completely
negative
for
any
metastatic
process
involving
the
brain
.

Thus
,
a
heparin
sliding
scale
was
begun
.

Meanwhile
,
the
patient
&apos;s
eosinophilia
was
treated
with
a
trial
of
prednisone
.

She
also
developed
a
mild
urinary
tract
infection
which
responded
to
Bactrim
,
but
which
was
subsequently
stopped
because
of
diarrhea
.

The
conclusions
at
this
time
of
the
thyroid
cytologist
,
as
well
as
the
bone
pathologist
,
were
that
the
findings
were
diagnostic
of
papillary
thyroid
carcinoma
with
pulmonary
metastases
.

Dr.
Trial
was
subsequently
consulted
on
5/5
for
surgical
intervention
.

On
5/6/93
the
patient
underwent
a
right
thyroidectomy
with
sacrifice
of
the
right
recurrent
laryngeal
nerve
as
well
as
the
right
sternothyroid
muscle
and
lower
parathyroid
gland
.

She
underwent
autotransplantation
of
the
right
upper
parathyroid
gland
,
as
well
as
repair
of
a
right
posterior
membranous
tracheotomy
.

She
was
received
in
the
Respiratory
Intensive
Care
Unit
immediately
postoperatively
in
stable
condition
.

Her
rate
was
well
controlled
on
Digoxin
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
floor
on
5/7
.

On
the
ward
she
continued
a
gentle
diuresis
as
well
as
Solu-Medrol
therapy
.

Calcium
levels
remained
7.2
to
7.5
postoperatively
.

She
continued
to
improve
with
a
slight
hoarseness
in
her
voice
that
was
expected
.

She
continued
to
exhibit
asymptomatic
atrial
fibrillation
.

Anticoagulation
was
begun
on
the
third
postoperative
day
with
Coumadin
.

She
was
effectively
anticoagulated
with
a
PT
in
the
range
between
15
and
17
over
a
control
of
10
.

She
also
received
a
Radiation
Therapy
consult
for
local
control
of
her
invasive
carcinoma
.

She
did
well
on
the
ward
and
was
discharged
on
her
ninth
postoperative
day
.

status
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
is
a
57-year-old
nursing
home
resident
female
,
who
had
been
in
her
usual
state
of

health
until
about
three
weeks
ago
when
the
daughter
noted
she
was
sleeping
more
.

Per
record
,
she
has
had
multiple
episodes
in
the
last
week
of
changes
in
mental
status
.

EMTs
called
many
times
.

The
patient
would
awake
prior
to
arrival
and
not
need
transfer
.

The
patient
was
seen
at
the
Leonard
Morse/Metrowest
Medical
Center
on
09-28
.

No
localizing
etiology
of
delta
MS
.

That
evening
she
was
unresponsive
and
the
patient
was
brought
to
Amesbury
Hospital
Hospital
.

There
her
oxygen
she
was
sating
65%
on
room
air
,
increased
to
98%
with
a
nonrebreather
mask
.

There
an
ABG
was
done
which
showed
an
ABG
of
7.42
,
62
,
and
55
.

She
had
a
head
CT
that
was
negative
.

Chest
x-ray
that
was
questionable
left
lower
lobe
infiltrate
.

Lumbar
puncture
was
performed
and
the
micro
cultures
are
still
pending
.

She
was
seen
by
Psychiatry
at
the
outside
hospital
,
but
noted
there
was
no
psychoses
,
but
delirium
.

The
patient
's
mental
status
waxed
and
waned
there
.

She
also
had
a
K
of
6.0
and
given
30
of
Kayexalate
,
5
of
Haldol
,
2
mg
of
Ativan
given
for

agitation
,
and
2
mg
of
ceftriaxone
was
given
for
a
temperature
of
101.3
with
a
concern
for
meningitis
as
a
LP
was
done
prior
.

Patient
was
transferred
to
the
Kindred
Hospital
Melendez
the
patient
's
primary
care
provider
was
here
.

She
is
currently
being
seen
by
Addison
Gilbert
Hospital
Group
.

On
arrival
to
Mass.
Eye
&
Ear
Infirmary
,
she
was
unresponsive
with
an
oxygen
saturation
of
72%
on
6
liters
.

She
was
placed
on
50%
vent
mask
,
which
improved
her
oxygenation
to
97%
.

Patient
was
placed
on
BiPAP
.

Original
ABG
here
before
BiPAP
was
7.19
,
102
,
and
92
.

After
being
placed
on
BiPAP
,
her
blood
pressure
decreased
to
the
80s
.

She
responded
to
1
liter
of
IV
fluids
,
normal
saline
and
blood
pressure
remained
stable
.

Patient
had
peripheral
IV
x1
placed
and
right
femoral
line
placed
in
the
Matthew
.

When
laying
flat
,
her
sats
decreased
to
50%
on
30%
FIO2
,
PEEP
of
10
,
and
pressure
support
of
5
.

Her
ABG
at
the
time
was
7.24
,
91
,
and
38
.

Once
the
patient
sat
up
,
her
sats
improved
and
her
airway
was
no
longer
obstructed
.

After
a
history
on
BiPAP
about
a
half
an
hour
,
her
ABG
was
7.29
,
79
,
and
106
on
30%
pressure
support
of
5
and
PEEP
of
10
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1.
Hypercarbic
respiratory
failure
issues
:

The
patient
presented
with
changes
in
mental
status
,
pCO2
of
100
,
pH
of
7.19
,
decreasing
sats
on
arrival
likely
element
of
obstructive-sleep
apnea
.

She
was
monitored
overnight
.

She
had
admitted
to
the
CMED
and
had
multiple
episodes
of
apnea
throughout
the
night
.

She
was
placed
on
pressure
support
,
which
improved
her
saturations
and
decreased
her
hypercarbia
.

Patient
improved
that
her
mental
status
with
improvement
of
her
oxygenation
and
ventilation
as
well
as
for
correction
of
her
respiratory
acidosis
.

Patient
was
eventually
placed
on
BiPAP
on
hospital
day
three
,
on
the
date
prior
to
discharge
of
BiPAP
settings
of
12/8/5
liters
of
oxygen
with
saturations
of
96%
with
a
gas
of
7.38
,
67
,
and
91
with
an
aim
of
a
goal
pCO2
of
67
.

She
only
had
one
episode
of
apnea
on
the
day
prior
to
discharge
.

2.
Delta
MS/mental
status
issues
:

Most
likely
her
waxing
and
waning
mental
status
and
hypercarbia/hypoxia
compounded
by
infection
of
pneumonia
and
UTI
.

With
improvements
of
her
ventilation
and
oxygenation
and
treatment
with
levofloxacin
of
her
UTI
and
pneumonia
,
her
mental
status
greatly
improved
on
hospital
day
two
without
further
waxing
and
waning
.

Her
daughters
came
by
and
visited
her
,
and
reported
that
she
was
at
her
baseline
mental
status
on
the
day
prior
to
discharge
.

B12
,
folate
,
RPR
were
all
sent
that
were
unremarkable
as
causes
for
delta
MS
.

We
are
awaiting
results
of
the
lumbar
puncture
from
the
outside
hospital
,
but
on
hospital
day
two
.

Those
cultures
are
still
pending
at
the
time
.

Patient
was
also
given
multivites
.

3.
Fever
issues
:

The
patient
initially
presented
with
T
max
of
101.3
at
outside
hospital
with
increasing
white
blood
cell
counts
and
a
positive
urinalysis
.

A
chest
x-ray
with
bilateral
patchy
infiltrates
likely
pneumonia
and
UTI
.

Upon
calling
the
outside
hospital
,
the
urine
was
growing
out
Klebsiella
,
and
patient
was
given
a
10
day
course
of
levofloxacin
to
cover
both
the
pneumonia
and
UTI
.

Blood
cultures
and
urine
cultures
are
still
pending
at
this
hospital
visit
and
the
CSF
fluid
from
Whitter
Rehabilitation
Hospital
needs
to
be
further
evaluated
.

Patient
on
the
day
of
discharge
was
afebrile
with
a
decreasing
white
count
x48
hours
.

4.
Acute
renal
failure
issues
:

Creatinine
initially
presented
at
1.3
.

Patient
is
known
to
have
a
baseline
of
1.0
,
most
likely
hypovolemia
and
prerenal
.

A
FENa
was
sent
,
was
0.3%
.

Patient
was
gently
hydrated
and
IV
fluids
started
up
on
a
p.o.
diet
regimen
.

On
hospital
day
two
,
her
creatinine
returned
to
0.8
,
and
she
remained
with
a
creatinine
of
0.8
for
the
remainder
of
her
hospital
stay
.

Patient's
K
was
followed
,
and
trended
back
down
to
normal
on
the
day
of
discharge
at
3.9
.

5.
Elevated
transaminases
:

Patient
had
no
right
upper
quadrant
pain
.

Stewart
sign
was
negative
.

A
right
upper
quadrant
ultrasound
was

.

Her
uterus
and
adnexa
were
difficult
to
assess
secondary
to
voluntary
tensing
of
her
abdomen
.

ASSESSMENT
:

This
is
a
49-year-old
gravida
III
,
para
II
,
status
post
uterine
artery
embolization
on
2009-01-07
due
to
uterine
fibroids
,
with
continued
abdominal
pain
and
CT
scan
revealing
fluid
and
gas
in
the
endometrial
cavity
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
and
was
initially
started
on
intravenous
ampicillin
,
gentamicin
and
clindamycin
.

Her
initial
white
blood
cell
count
was
11.3
,
with
a
normal
differential
.

Her
sedimentation
rate
was
elevated
at
110
.

Her
electrolytes
were
within
normal
limits
.

She
was
maintained
on
intravenous
antibiotics
.

On
hospital
day
number
three
,
her
blood
cultures
came
back
positive
in
the
anaerobic
culture
for
gram-positive
cocci
in
pairs
and
clusters
.

Further
identification
revealed
staphylococcus
coag-negative
,
which
was
sensitive
to
gentamicin
and
clindamycin
.

She
was
continued
on
her
antibiotics
,
and
was
afebrile
until
hospital
day
number
five
,
when
she
had
a
temperature
spike
to
102.3
.

Repeat
blood
cultures
were
sent
.

Her
white
blood
cell
count
was
12.8
,
with
a
normal
differential
.

At
this
time
,
an
Infectious
Disease
consult
was
obtained
,
and
the
recommendation
was
to
discontinue
the
ampicillin
,
gentamicin
and
clindamycin
,
and
start
her
on
intravenous
Unasyn
.

She
underwent
a
pelvic
ultrasound
and
an
abdomen
and
pelvis
CT
,
which
revealed
continued
air
in
the
endometrial
cavity
vs.
in
the
fundal
fibroid
.

Discussion
was
had
at
this
time
with
the
patient
regarding
whether
or
not
this
represented
an
infected
abscess
vs.
post-surgical
change
.

Extensive
discussion
was
held
,
and
second
opinion
was
obtained
regarding
the
need
for

possible
drainage
of
the
abscess
vs.
hysterectomy
.

The
patient
requested
an
outside
second
opinion
,
as
she
was
reluctant
to
undergo
hysterectomy
at
this
time
.

She
was
discharged
to
home
on
hospital
day
number
eight
,
on
oral
antibiotics
.

The
patient
was
to
have
a
repeat
CT
scan
in
one
week
.

She
was
also
to
obtain
a
second
opinion
regarding
the
question
of
possible
surgical
management
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
73
year
old
female
who
was
transferred
for
cardiac
catheterization
after
ventricular
fibrillation
arrest
in
the
setting
of
an
acute
inferior
myocardial
infarction
and
a
urinary
tract
infection
.

The
patient
was
admitted
on
3-16-93
to
Diy
Hospital
for
an
E.
coli
urinary
tract
infection
.

The
patient
was
readmitted
on
3-20-93
because
of
fever
,
chills
and
a
sudden
onset
of
ventricular
fibrillation
arrest
,
successfully
cardioverted
back
to
rapid
atrial
fibrillation
and
finally
to
sinus
rhythm
,
where
an
electrocardiogram
then
showed
ST
elevation
in
inferior
leads
.

Peak
CPK
was
2494
with
18%
MB
's
.

She
required
intubation
for
mild
to
moderate
congestive
heart
failure
,
treated
with
diuretics
,
intravenous
nitroglycerin
and
heparin
.

She
had
post-infarction
angina
,
was
transferred
here
for
angiography
and
possible
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

On
physical
examination
,
blood
pressure
is
130/80
,
pulse
74
and
regular
,
respirations
14
.

Her
chest
demonstrated
bibasilar
crackles
.

Cardiovascular
exam
:

the
jugular
venous
pressure
was
seven
centimeters
,
carotid
upstroke
normal
.

The
heart
exam
revealed
a
normal
Sl
and
S2
was
normally
split
.

There
was
an
S4
,
no
S3
,
grade
II/VI
apical
murmur
in
systole
,
no
rubs
.

The
abdomen
was
benign
,
unremarkable
.

Extremities
:

no
calf
tenderness
or
peripheral
edema
.

Peripheral
pulses
were
2+
and
symmetrical
bilaterally
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

On
3-27-93
,
patient
underwent
cardiac
catheterization
,
coronary
and
left
ventricular
angiography
without
complications
.

Review
of
these
angiograms
demonstrated
a
dominant
right
coronary
artery
with
a
focal
50%
stenosis
in
the
mid-portion
.

The
left
main
coronary
artery
was
clear
.

The
left
anterior
descending
had
moderate
plaques
with
a
50%
proximal
stenosis
of
the
right
anterior
oblique
caudal
view
.

The
proximal
diagonal
D1
had
a
50%
stenosis
.

The
circumflex
had
a
long
30%
stenosis
proximally
and
an
80%
stenosis
at
the
origin
of
the
second
major
marginal
artery
.

The
left
ventricular
angiogram
showed
akinesis
of
the
posterobasal
walls
,
severe
hypokinesis
of
the
diaphragmatic
wall
and
trace
mitral
regurgitation
.

The
patient
was
maintained
on
heparin
anticoagulation
.

An
exercise
tolerance
test
with
Thallium
was
to
be
performed
in
order
to
assess
myocardial
viability
in
the
infarct
zone
.

The
right
coronary
artery
lesion
was
complex
and
there
was
severe
stenosis
in
the
obtuse
marginal
1
.

The
patient
had
no
further
angina
.

On
4-2-93
,
she
underwent
a
Persantine
Thallium
study
.

This
showed
no
diagnostic
electrocardiogram
changes
for
ischemia
and
no
angina
pectoris
.

The
thallium
images
showed
a
large
region
of
persistently
reduced
blood
flow
involving
the
apex
and
inferoposterior
segments
of
the
left
ventricular
wall
.

This
was
consistent
with
scar
.

There
was
no
definite
perfusion
abnormality
in
the
circumflex
zone
.

In
view
of
these
findings
,
it
was
elected
to
discharge
her
on
her
present
medical
program
.

The
patient
is
to
return
to
the
follow
up
care
of
Dr.
Ko
Kollciem
at
the
Diy
Hospital

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
is
an
86
year
old
woman
who
has
a
history
of
atrial

disease
,
and
a
history
of
atrial
emboli
who
was
admitted
on
2013-09-06
,
to
the
Neurologic
Intensive
Care
Unit
service
after
collapsing
at
home
at
8:30
p.m
.

She
was
found
to
have
right
sided
weakness
and
was
noted
by
her
husband
to
have
vomited
.

She
was
found
comatose
at
home
by
EMS
and
was
brought
to
the
Emergency
Department
.

On
arrival
to
the
Emergency
Department
,
she
was
noted
to
have
a
temperature
of
98.2
,
blood
pressure
164/110
,
respiratory
rate
28
,
and
heart
rate
of
74
.

She
was
found
to
be
responsive
only
to
painful
stimuli
at
this
time
.

She
was
intubated
for
airway
protection
and
received
multiple
medications
prior
to
her
initial
neurologic
examination
.

She
was
also
noted
to
have
a
cold
distal
left
upper
extremity
which
was
operated
on
and
she
is
now
status
post
left
brachial
artery
embolectomy
.

Throughout
her
course
on
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
service
,

infarction
with
mass
effect
and
midline
shift
.

There
is
evidence
of
bilateral
occipital
and
cerebellar
infarctions
as
well
.

Discussion
with
the
patient
's
family

an
anterior
myocardial
infarction
in
September
of
1993
and
a
non-Q
wave
myocardial
infarction
in
February
of
1993
.

The
patient
in
September
of
1993
had
3-4
millimeter
ST
segment
elevation
in

.

At
the
time
,
patient
had
bright
red
blood
per
rectum
as
well
and
patient
had
cardiac
catheterization
at
the
time
which
showed
95%
left
anterior
descending
,
which
was
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplastied
and
had
intra-aortic
balloon
pump
placement
.

He
had
a
CPK
of
over
5000
with
MB
fraction
of
26.7
.

The
echocardiogram
showed
a
44%
ejection
fraction
with
anterior
akinesis
and
septal
hypokinesis
.

He
had
a
positive
exercise
tolerance
test
with
Thallium
and
repeat

.

In
February
of
1993
,
patient
again
presented
with
chest
pain
,
shortness
of
breath
,
ruled
in
for
a
non-Q
wave
myocardial
infarction
with
CPK
peak
of
219
and
MB
of
20.9
.

Repeat
cardiac
catheterization
showed
re-stenosis
of
proximal
left
anterior
descending
that
had
been
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplastied
and
a

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
65
year
old
Portuguese
male
with
a
history
of
an
anterior
myocardial
infarction
i
May
1993
and
is
status
post
a
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasty
of
the
LAD
who
presented
on
10-24-93
with
crushing
substernal
chest
pain
and
shortness
of
breath
.

He
had
no
prior
cardiac
history
until
May
1993
when
on
5-24
he
had
crushing
chest
pain
which
radiated
to
his
left
arm
.

He
was
found
at
that
time
to
have
3-4
mm
ST
segment
elevations
in
V1
through
V4
at
Pre
Health
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
and
had
4-7
mm
ST
segment
elevations
across
the
precordium
with
Q&apos;s
in
V1
and
V2
,
2
mm
ST
elevation
in
AVL
,
and
1-2
mm
reciprocal
ST
depression
in
II
,
III
,
and
F.

On
physical
examination
at
that
time
he
had
bright
red
blood
per
rectum
and
therefore
lysis
was
deferred
and
he
was
taken
directly
to
the
cardiac
catheterization
lab
.

The
cardiac
catheterization
results
at
that
time
revealed
a
right
atrial
pressure
of
7
,
pulmonary
artery
pressure
of
29/16
,
RV
33/8
,
pulmonary
capillary
wedge
pressure
of
16
.

He
had
a
95%
proximal
left
anterior
descending
lesion
which
was
PTCA
&apos;d
to
a
residual
of
30%
and
an
intra-aortic
balloon
pump
was
placed
.

He
also
had
some
mild
to
moderate
disease
at
the
OM1
noted
at
that
time
.

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
Cardiac
Care
Unit
where
he
had
a
peak
CPK
of
5,042
and
26.7%
MB&apos;s
.

His
intra-aortic
balloon
pump
was
weaned
without
problems
.

He
had
hypotension
with
beta
blockers
and
therefore
they
were
not
started
.

On
day
six
,
an
echocardiogram
showed
an
ejection
fraction
of
44%
with
anterior
akinesis
and
septal
hypokinesis
.

On
day
nine
,
he
had
a
low
level
exercise
tolerance
test
with
Thallium
which
was
positive
for
2.5
mm
horizontal
depressions
in
II
,
III
,
and
AVF
,
and
1.5
mm
downsloping
ST
depressions
in
V5
and
V6
,
as
well
as
some
anteroseptal
redistribution
on
Thallium
.

Therefore
,
he
went
to
repeat
cardiac
catheterization
which
revealed
that
the
left
anterior
descending
site
was
patent
and
revealed
a
distal
PDA
lesion
and
a
circumflex
lesion
after
the
OM
.

The
patient
was
discharged
to
home
and
is
supposed
to
follow
up
with
Dr.
Shuffburle
of
Gastroenterology
for
work
up
of
his
bright
red
blood
per
rectum
and
is
supposed
to
follow
up
with
Dr.
Amesin
of
Cardiology
and
Dr.
Shuffpasc
of
Dingclearf
Alllirefaith
Memorial
Hospital
.

However
,
he
did
not
keep
any
of
these
appointments
.

He
went
home
and
did
not
take
any
of
his
medications

LABORATORY
DATA
:

The
laboratory
data
revealed
normal
electrolytes
,
BUN
and
creatinine
,
normal
liver
function
tests
,
a
first
CPK
of
140
,
and
a

normal
axis
,
had
poor
R-wave
progression
consistent
with
an

,
had
flipped
T-waves
in
V1
through
V5
,
which
were
of
no
significant
change
since
his
last
EKG
on
5-25-93
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Step
Down
Unit
for
a
rule
out
MI
protocol
.

He
was
treated
with
aspirin
,
heparin
,
and
intravenous
nitroglycerin
.

No
beta
blockers
was
started
because
of
his
history
of
hypertension
with
beta
blockers
and
because
his
blood
pressure
of
only
110/70
.

The
patient
ruled
in
for
myocardial
infarction
with
a
peak
CPK
of
219
and
20.9%
MB
fraction
.

This
was
a
non-Q
wave
myocardial
infarction
as
there
were
no
diagnostic
electrocardiogram
changes
.

on
10-27-93
,
the
patient
went
to
the
cath
lab
which
revealed
a
small
nondominant
right
coronary
artery
without
any
lesions
,
a
restenosis
of
the
proximal
left
anterior
descending
lesion
that
had
been
PTCA
&apos;d
,
a
lesion
in
the
first
OM
,
and
a
moderately
severe
left
circumflex
lesion
after
the
OM3
.

The
left
ventriculogram
revealed
an
akinetic
anterolateral
and
apical
ventricle
.

Given
the
results
of
this
cardiac
catheterization
,
which
were
not
significantly
changed
from
his
previous
cardiac
catheterization
prior
to
the
PTCA
,
it
was
elected
to
attempt
to
medically
manage
the
patient
.

He
was
ambulated
progressively
on
the
floor
.

A
beta
blocker
was
started
with
Metoprolol
initially
at
25
mg
PO
bid
and
eventually
increased
to
50
mg
PO
bid
.

The
patient
ambulated
extensively
on
the
FIH
20
floor
each
day
without
any
episodes
of
chest
pain
or
shortness
of
breath
.

On
11-2-93
,
the
patient
underwent
a
low
level
treadmill
exercise
test
with
Thallium
imaging
.

This
treadmill
test
was
done
on
medications
,
including
beta
blockers
,
in
hopes
to
assess
an
amount
of
ischemia
on
treatment
.

The
patient
was
able
to
exercise
for
approximately
nine
minutes
on
a
modified
Bruce
protocol
,
however
,
he
did
not
reach
his
predicted
maximal
heart
rate
while
he
was
on
the
beta
blockade
.

There
were
no
diagnostic
electrocardiogram
changes
during
the
treadmill
exercise
test
,
although
he
did
have
0.5
to
1
mm
ST
depression
in
II
,
III
,
and
AVF
.

The
study
was
halted
for
shortness
of
breath
and
there
was
no
chest
pain
.

Thallium
images
revealed
a
moderate
sized
region
of
ischemic
but
viable
myocardium
involving
the
anteroseptal
and
lateral
segments
of
the
left
ventricle
.

There
was
also
some
evidence
of
left
ventricular
dysfunction
during
the
test
.

These
images
were
essentially
unchanged
compared
with
the
previous
Thallium
images
in
May
1993
.

After
extensive
discussion
between
myself
,
Dr.
Amesin
,
and
Dr.
Scgach
,
it
was
elected
to
discharge
the
patient
to
home
with
medical
management
.

The
patient
was
extremely
reluctant
to
undergo
surgery
,
although
he
understands
that
this
may
become
necessary
in
the
future
.

Dr.
Amesin
had
a
long
discussion
with
the
patient
&apos;s
daughters
revolving
primarily
around
issues
of
the
patient
&apos;s
compliance
.

Previously
he
had
not
taken
any
of
his
medicines
and
smoked
heavily
on
the
outside
and
not
kept
any
of
his
appointments
.

The
importance
of
quitting
smoking
as
well
as
continuing
to
follow
his
medical
regimen
was
emphasized
to
the
daughter
and
to
the
patient
.

She
will
be
actively
involved
in
encouraging
the
patient
to
comply
with
this
medical
regimen
and
also
to
follow
up
with
Dr.
Amesin
as
well
as
Dr.
Lfsquarc
on
the
outside
.

The
patient
remained
guaiac
negative
throughout
the
entire
hospitalization
.

Despite
being
on
heparin
for
a
short
time
,
his
hematocrit
remained
very
stable
with
only
a
small
dip
after
the
catheterization
was
done
.

He
will
need
to
be
followed
up
as
an
out
patient
for
guaiac
positive
stools
and
possibly
worked
up
for
this
in
the
future
.

.

Patient
febrile
in
the

.

High
WBC
.

It
was
thought
that
it
could
have
been
a

of
hypotension
,
hypercapnia
and
infection
.

He
was
initially
started
on
broad

antibiotics
.

Despite
having
a
profund
limitation
communicating
given
his
neurological

,
his
mental
changes
seemed
to
improved
initially
.

However
later
on
during
his
course
,
his
mental

deteriorated
,
being
even
less

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
is
an
83
-
year-old
male
with
a
history
of
diabetes
,
steroid-treated
polymyalgia
rheumatica
,
hypertension
,
benign
prostatic
hypertrophy
,
and
high
cholesterol
without
presented
to
the
hospital
for
lower
extremity
angiograph
;
however
,
that
was
deferred
due
to
new
onset
renal
failure
.

1.
RENAL
FAILURE
:

The
patient
was
initially
thought
to
be
prerenal
,
and
his
renal
status
improved
after
hydration
and
increased
oral
intake
.

He
did
have
a
magnetic
resonance
angiography
of
his
kidneys
which
showed
mild
right-sided
renal
artery
stenosis
.

His
renal
function
fluctuated
throughout
his
hospital
stay
,
and
when
he
was
in
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
he
did
have
decreased
urine
output
in
the
setting
of
cardiogenic
shock
.

2.
CARDIOVASCULAR
:

The
patient
with
severe
peripheral
vascular
disease
.

During
his
hospital
stay
,
he
developed
some
nonsustained
ventricular
tachycardia
.

He
also
became
hypotensive
on
07-02
in
the
setting
of
infection
.

The
patient
had
a
central
line
placed
and
went
into
sustained
ventricular
tachycardia
that
was
treated
with
lidocaine
.

After
being
treated
with
lidocaine
,
the
patient
became
apneic
requiring
intubation
and
transfer
to
the
Coronary
Care
Unit
.

His
nonsustained
ventricular
tachycardia
was
treated
with
a
lidocaine
drip
.

It
was
found
that
he
had
elevated
troponins
and
likely
an
ischemic
event
on
the
07-02
.

A
repeat
echocardiogram
showed
a
decreased
ejection
fraction
from
prior
.

He
had
a
cardiac
catheterization
which
revealed
3-vessel
disease
.

Cardiothoracic
Surgery
was
consulted
,
and
due
to
the
patient
's
acute
illness
,
they
wanted
to
re-evaluate
after
the
patient
was
extubated
.

The
patient
continued
to
have
intermittent
episodes
of
ventricular
tachycardia
.

He
was
continued
on
lidocaine
and
eventually
changed
over
to
amiodarone
.

He
was
noted
to
be
cardiogenic
shock
requiring
pressors
.

Of
note
,
he
likely
suffered
a
second
ischemic
event
during
his
Coronary
Care
Unit
stay
.

The
patient
did
have
a
Swan-Ganz
catheter
in
place
and
had
a
low
cardiac
output
.

The
patient
's
family
eventually
decided
to
withdraw
care
,
and
the
patient
was
extubated
and
passed
away
on
2009-07-12
.

2.
INFECTIOUS
DISEASE
:

The
patient
was
initially
treated
with
levofloxacin
for
a
left
lower
lobe
infiltrate
and
a
urinary
tract
infection
.

He
then
developed
positive
blood
cultures
with
Staphylococcus
aureus
sensitive
to
levofloxacin
,
and
that
was
continued
.

When
the
patient
became
hypotensive
and
required
intubation
and
pressors
,
his
antibiotics
were
broadened
,
and
he
was
put
on
stress-dose
steroids
.

He
was
found
to
have
bilateral
Staphylococcus
pneumonia
.

3.
PULMONARY
:

The
patient
required
intubation
in
the
setting
of
hypotension
and
ventricular
tachycardia
.

He
was
actually
extubated
on
07-09
,
but
then
reintubated
one
hour
later
due
to
hypoxia
.

He
was
also
found
to
have
a
bilateral
Staphylococcus
pneumonia
.

DISCHARGE
DISPOSITION
:

On
07-12
,
after
and
extensive
family
meeting
,
the
family
decided
to
extubate
the
patient
and
make
him
comfortable
,
and
he
passed
away
at

echocardiogram
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
with
a
right
occipital
cerebral
infarction
.

The
patient
was
started
on
intravenous
heparin
and
had
the
studies
as
described
above
for
rule
out
source
of
embolic
strokes
including
carotid
noninvasives
,
transcranial
Dopplers
,
Holter
electrocardiogram
and
echocardiogram
.

The
patient
also
had
serial
electrocardiogram
,
which
showed
no
change
.

The
patient
also
had
serial
creatinine
kinase
with
MB
fractions
studied
,
which
revealed
MB
fraction
too
low
to
be
tested
.

The
patient
also
experienced
a
feeling
of
moving
back
and
forth
when
lying
down
with
neck
extended
during
the
magnetic
resonance
imaging
study
and
also
in
bed
.

This
moving
sense
,
with
normal
electroencephalogram
,
was
thought
to
be
a
mild
vestibular
dysfunction
or
from
the
acute
episode
of
the
stroke
.

The
patient
will
have
these
symptoms
only
when
the
eyes
are
closed
.

Our
opinion
was
not
to
intervene
or
have
any
further
studies
for
acute
period
and
to
continued
to
observe
.

The
patient
did
have
a
hypotensive
episode
and
the
systolic
blood
pressure
was
80
,
after
the
patient
received
his
regular
cardiac
medications
.

The
patient
had
been
off
his
regular
medications
since
during
the
admission
and
will
be
discharged
off
his
medications
.

Otherwise
,
there
were
no
further
episodes
of
blurred
vision
.

The
patient
was
stable
with
an
unchanged
neurological
and
physical
examination
and
was
discharged
on
aspirin
325
mg
po
qd
,
on
May
14
,
1995
.

The
patient
will
be
randomized
on
the
Wars
study
early
next
week
by
the
Stroke
Service
at
Ph
University
Of
Medical
Center
.

89
and
status
post
multiple
percutaneous
transluminal
coronary
angioplasties
who
recently
had
a
catheterization
done
in
Mississippi
and
stent
placed
in
2013-03-24
.

The
patient
did
well

to
experience
increased
dyspnea
on
exertion
.

One
week
prior
to
presentation
,
he
had
chest
pain
leading
to
a
repeat
catheterization
at
Springfield
on
07-30
which
showed
narrowing
of
the
stent
and
an
ejection
fraction
of
approximately
20%
.

No
intervention
was
done
at
that
point
.

On
the
evening
prior
to
admission
,
the
patient
was
awoken
with
chest
pressure
radiating
to
the
neck

fourth
re-awakening
,
the
patient
presented
to
the
Emergency
Department
at
Springfield

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
transferred
to
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
further
management
for
acute
GI
bleed
.

1.
Gastrointestinal
bleed
:

The
patient
continued
to
receive
blood
transfusions
on
the
floor
and
serial
hematocrits
with
serial
INR
checks
were
drawn
.

As
he
was
receiving
his
third
unit
of
packed
red
blood
cells
,
the
patient
became
tachycardic
and
short
of
breath
.

His
temperature
raised
from
98.6
F.
,
to
101.0
F.

He
was
shown
to
have
rigors
.

The
transfusion
was
stopped
and
the
patient
was
given
Tylenol
1
mg
with
epinephrine
,
100
mg
of
hydrocortisone
,
25
mg
of
Benadryl
and
Demerol
15
as
well
as
Pepcid
.

He
had
emesis
times
three
of
75
cc
of
coffee
ground
material
.

The
patient
also
desaturated
to
the
low
80
s
and
was
started
on
a
non-rebreather
mask
.

His
saturations
improved
quickly
on
100%
non-rebreather
mask
within
15
to
20
minutes
.

Shortly
after
his
mental
status
changed
;
he
became
disoriented
and
euphoric
and
continued
to
be
in
this
state
for
two
more
hours
.

After
that
period
of
time
,
his
mental
status
gradually
improved
and
he
continued
to
receive
his
blood
transfusions
requiring
a
total
of
ten
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
and
four
units
of
fresh
frozen
plasma
to
reach
a
hematocrit
of
30.0
,
which
remained
stable
for
the
duration
of
his
stay
.

On
admission
,
the
patient
was
started
on
high
dose
proton
pump
inhibitors
for
prophylaxis
.

On
Wednesday
,
11-25
,
an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy
was
performed
and
was
significant
for
the
following
findings
:

Medium
hiatal
hernia
,
Barrett's
esophagus
,
erosion
of
the
gastroesophageal
junction
,
granularity
,
erythema
and
congestion
of
the
antrum
in
the
pre-pyloric
region
compatible
with
gastritis
.

Erosions
in
the
antrum
and
pre-pyloric
region
,
granularity
,
erythema
and
congestion
of
the
anterior
bulb
and
posterior
bulb
compatible
with
duodenitis
.

It
was
recommended
by
Gastroenterology
that
the
patient
is
to
stay
off
aspirin
for
at
least
four
to
six
weeks
at
discharge
to
prevent
further
bleeding
.

2.
Cardiovascular
:

During
transfusion
reaction
episode
,
the
patient
had
an
episode
of
tachycardia
ranging
from
134
to
158
,
for
one
to
two
hours
.

EKG
during
this
episode
was
taken
and
showed
sinus
tachycardia
;
however
,
serial
enzymes
were
significant
for
CK
peaking
at
1075
,
MB
peaking
at
114
and
MB
index
peaking
at
10.8
,
consistent
with
myocardial
damage
.

The
day
following
this
episode
,
EKG
showed
loss
of
R
wave
progression
in
anterior
leads
and
Q
waves
in
leads
III
and
AVF
consistent
with
anteroseptal
myocardial
infarction
.

The
patient
's
blood
pressures
remained
stable
during
his
stay
.

He
had
no
episodes
of
arrhythmia
on
Telemetry
.

Cardiology
consultation
was
obtained
.

The
myocardial
infarction
was
attributed
to
demand
ischemia
secondary
to
acute
hematocrit
drop
exacerbated
by
tachycardia
secondary
to
blood
transfusion
reaction
.

Further
Cardiologic
work-up
was
suggested
as
an
outpatient
at
four
to
six
weeks
post
discharge
.

The
patient
was
started
on
Lopressor
,
Lipitor
and
Lisinopril
.

3.
After
ten
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
and
four
units
of
fresh
frozen
plasma
transfusions
,
the
patient
's
hematocrit
remained
stable
at
above
30
.

His
INR
decreased
to
1.3
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

He
required
no
blood
transfusions
for
four
days
prior
to
discharge
.

4.
History
of
pulmonary
embolism
likely
secondary
to
frequent
flying
.

The
need
for
further
anti-coagulation
was
discussed
with
the
patient
's
attending
,
Dr.
Coleman
,
and
it
was
decided
not
to
continue
anti-coagulation
due
to
increased
risk
of
gastrointestinal
bleeding
.

The
patient
remained
symptom
free
during
his
stay
in
the
hospital
,
saturating
well
in
room
air
.

5.
Endocrine
:

The
patient
was
restarted
on
Levothyroxine
soon
after
admission
.

His
hemoglobin
A1C
was
sent
and
it
was
pending
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

6.
Single
mental
status
change
times
two
hours
during
episode
of
blood
transfusion
reaction
.

Was
most
likely
due
to
multiple
drugs
administered
during
the
episode
including
Demerol
.

After
this
episode
,
the
patient
's
mental
status
remained
clear
for
the
rest
of
the
duration
of
his
stay
.

7.
Prophylaxis
:

The
patient
was
sent
home
on
proton
pump
inhibitors
.

His
Helicobacter
pylori
serology
was
sent
and
was
pending
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

20
.

The
head
,
eyes
,
ears
,
nose
,
throat
and
neck
examinations
were
unremarkable
.

Cardiac
examination
was
remarkable
for
frequent
ectopic

.

The
lung
examination
was
clear
but
breath
sounds
were
more
pronounced
on
the
left
than
the
right
.

Abdomen
:

soft
,
obese
with
mild
epigastric
and
right
upper
quadrant
tenderness
.

An
intact
colostomy
was
present
.

No
masses

be
palpated
secondary
to
the
patient
&apos;s
extreme
obesity
.

Extremities
:

unremarkable
.

The
neurological
examination
was
remarkable
for
a
peripheral
neuropathy
including
decreased
sensation
in
the
lower
extremities
with
decreased
strength
in
the
upper
and

.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
and
underwent
celiac
and
superior
mesenteric
artery
angiography
which
demonstrated
a
patent
celiac
and
superior
mesenteric
artery
with
normal
branching
pattern
.

His
preoperative
workup
was
completed
and
included
a
normal
white

The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
well
with
a
2000
cc.
blood
loss
and
was
autotransfused
two
units
of
blood
.

In
the
postoperative
course
Mr.
Fyfe
did
surprisingly
well
given
his
underlying
medical
condition
.
,

He
did
require
two
units
of
transfused
blood
but
otherwise
did
quite
well
and
was
extubated
on
the
night
of
surgery
.

He
remained
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
two
days
but
was
hemodynamically
stable
throughout
.

He
continued
to
manifest
occasional
premature
ventricular
contractions
,
but
these
were
unchanged
from
preoperatively
and
the
patient
otherwise
did
well
.

His
nasogastric
tube
was
discontinued
and
he
was
begun
on
clear
liquids
and
subsequently
advanced
to
a
regular
diet
without
difficulty
.

Both
of
his
Jackson-Pratt
drains
were
removed
without
incident
.

By

kilocalorie
diet
without
difficulty
with
all
of
his
tubes
and
drains
removed
.

His
wound
was
noted
to
be
healing
well
and
his
colostomy
functioning
appropriately
without
significant
difficulty
.

He
is
being
transferred

severe
anemia
which
has
since
resolved
.

He
remained
hemodynamically
stable
throughout
this
admission
.

started
prophylactically
on
phototherapy
.

His
bilirubin
peaked
on
day
of
life
three
at
5.4
with
a
subsequent
bilirubin
of
4.6
at
which
time
phototherapy
was
discontinued
.

5.
Hematology
:

Given
the
rapid
extension
of
the
subgaleal
bleed
,
coagulopathy
workup
was
initiated
revealing
an
elevated
PTT
level
of
77
as
well
as
factor
8
level
that
was
below
detection
in
the
presence
of
normal
factors
5
,
9
,
10
,
and
11
.

He
was
started
on

divided
until
hourly
infusion
rates
at
05-10
.

Subsequent
factor
8
levels
varied
with
an
initial
factor
8
level
of
18
after
the
bolus
with
which
he
received
another
bolus
of
factor
8
of
50
units
/
kg
and
increased
factor
8
infusion
rate
to
65
units

administration
.

His
peak
level
after
a
bolus
of
75
units
/
kg
of
factor
8
was
131
.

A
trough
level
at
20
hours
after
the
bolus
on
day
of
discharge
was
29
.

He
will
continue
to
receive
factor
8
bolus
q
day
for
a
total
of
2-3
weeks
in
light
of
the
intracranial
hemorrhage
,
and
will
be
followed
by
Hematology
visiting
nurse

Edwards
level
checks
at
home
.

Currently
,
the
infusion
of
factor

for
administration
of
factor
.

His
last
PTT
on
05-16
was
68.3
.

The
last
hematocrit
was
on
05-16
of

Neurology
:

Baby
Mary
Stead
initially
presented
with
significant
subgaleal
bleed
as
well
as
a
small
subdural
hemorrhage
.

A
repeat
head
CT
scan
on
05-15
had
shown
the
resolution
of
the
subdural
hematoma
and
significant
improvement
of
the
subgaleal
bleed
.

His
head
ultrasound
on
05-14
reveals
no
interventricular
hemorrhage
.

He
had
remained

p.o.
steroid
taper
,
which
he
tolerated
well
,
and
was
discharged
on
a
steroid
taper
also
with
CMED
CSRU
follow-up
as
an
outpatient
.

His
oxygenation
and
symptoms
remained
stable
and
again
tolerated
p.o.
without
difficulty
.

Eventually
,
as
the
patient
remained
hemodynamically
stable
,
his
airway
remained
stable
,
and
he
was
tolerating
PO
s,
he
was
transitioned
to
the
floor
where
he
remained
otherwise
stable
and
asymptomatic
.

His
voice
improved
during
the
course
of
his
stay
and
was
talking
clearly
by
the
time
of
discharge
.

He
remained
afebrile
during
the
course
of
his
stay
after
transfer
to
the
floor
and
per
CMED
CSRU
was
to
be
discharged
on
a
2-week
course
of
Augmentin
with
follow-up
with
Dr.
Thibodeau
in
2
weeks
'

and
remained
stable
from

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
is
a
52
-
year-old
female
with
no
known
history
of
cardiac
disease
presenting
with
dyspnea
on
exertion
and
chest
tightness
,
who
was
admitted
for
evaluation
and
management
of
her
symptoms
.

1.
CARDIOVASCULAR
:

The
patient
was
admitted
for
complaints
of
dyspnea
on
exertion
and
chest
pressure
which
could
be
consistent
with
angina
.

However
,
given
the
long
duration
of
the
symptoms
and
negative
workup
in
the
past
,
it
was
thought
to
be
unlikely
.

However
,
the
patient
was
started
on
an
aspirin
as
well
as
a
beta
blocker
,
and
a
rule
out
myocardial
infarction
protocol
was
initiated
.

A
stress
thallium
was
planned
for
the
day
following
admission
.

However
,
on
the
night
of
admission
the
patient
was
found
lying
in
her
bed
diaphoretic
and
obtunded
,
and
a
code
was
called
.

Further
examination
revealed
a
strong
palpable
pulse
with
a
systolic
blood
pressure
in
the
130
s
and
a
heart
rate
in
the
80
s.

Over
the
course
of
the
next
few
minutes
the
patient
became
increasingly
more
responsive
.

She
was
treated
with
a
fluid
bolus
.

The
patient
quickly
responded
to
a
fluid
bolus
and
became
interactive
.

She
reported
that
she
was
sitting
on
the
commode
urinating
and
began
to
feel
nauseous
and
presyncopal
.

She
was
able
to
get
to
bed
at
which
point
she
passed
out
.

She
denied
any
chest
pain
or
pressure
,
and
no
shortness
of
breath
during
this
event
.

A
rhythm
check
obtained
during
the
time
of
this
event
demonstrated
a
pause
of
six
seconds
followed
by
a
junctional
escape
rhythm
.

An
electrocardiogram
obtained
after
the
code
demonstrated
no
acute
changes
.

Her
acute
bradycardic
event
was
felt
likely
secondary
to
her
new
beta
blocker
in
conjunction
with
a
vagal
response
.

It
was
determined
to
stop
the
beta
blocker
,
and
atropine
was
placed
at
the
bedside
.

On
the
following
day
the
patient
underwent
an
echocardiogram
which
demonstrated
dilated
right
ventricle
secondary
to
chronic
dysfunction
and
a
pulmonary
artery
pressure
of
greater
than
100
.

Her
stress
test
was
cancelled
.

A
CT
angiogram
was
ordered
to
evaluate
for
chronic
thromboembolic
disease
as
a
potential
cause
of
her
pulmonary
hypertension
.

She
was
ruled
out
for
myocardial
infarction
with
three
sets
of
normal
enzymes
and
continued
to
be
monitored
on
telemetry
.

A
Pulmonary
consultation
was
obtained
to
evaluate
for
possible
etiology
of
the
patient
's
hypotension
.

There
was
little
evidence
to
suggest
any
cardiac
disease
,
and
given
the
patient
's
Grave's
disease
an
autoimmune
process
was
felt
to
be
possible
.

In
addition
,
consideration
was
given
to
sarcoidosis
,
human
immunodeficiency
virus
,
and
drug-induced
given
her
history
of
herbal
medication
use
.

It
was
recommended
that
the
patient
begin
anticoagulation
given
the
severity
of
her
pulmonary
hypertension
.

It
was
also
planned
to
undergo
a
right
heart
catheterization
with
a
vasodilation
trial
by
the
catheterization
laboratory
.

A
right
heart
catheterization
was
performed
on
2014-12-05
.

A
pharmacologic
pulmonary
vasodilator
challenge
was
performed
with
a
positive
response
.

In
addition
,
a
CT
angiogram
of
the
chest
with
pulmonary
embolism
protocol
showed
no
intravascular
filling
defect
but
did
show
a
right
upper
lobe
ground-glass
and
scattered
adenopathy
.

Therefore
,
in
the
end
left
atrial
hypertension
was
essentially
ruled
out
as
a
primary
cause
.

Chronic
pulmonary
embolus
was
less
likely
given
her
negative
CT
angiogram
.

Chronic
lung
disease
was
unlikely
given
the
patient
's
normal
pulmonary
function
tests
and
DLCO
in
2012
as
well
as
a
normal
CT
angiogram
.

Collagen
vascular
disease
could
not
be
definitively
ruled
out
;
however
,
given
the
patient
's
lack
of
connective
tissue
disorder
stigmata
it
was
thought
to
be
less
likely
,
and
the
patient
's
human
immunodeficiency
virus
test
was
negative
.

Therefore
,
it
was
felt
that
the
patient
was
most
likely
experiencing
a
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
.

Consideration
was
given
to
treating
the
patient
with
a
course
of
calcium
channel
blocker
;
however
,
given
the
patient
's
poor
response
to
Lopressor
,
it
was
determined
that
this
would
not
be
optimal
treatment
for
the
patient
's
pulmonary
hypertension
.

Therefore
,
her
insurance
company
was
contacted
regarding
the
potential
of
Flolan
as
a
treatment
.

Plans
were
made
for
placement
of
a
Hickman
catheter
and
initiation
of
Flolan
treatment
.

However
,
on
12-07
,
the
patient
once
again
experienced
an
episode
of
unresponsiveness
.

Upon
arrival
by
the
physician
the
patient
was
awake
,
alert
,
and
oriented
with
a
pulse
in
the
80
s,
with
pressure
in
the
80
s,
and
satting
100%
on
room
air
.

She
described
this
episode
as
an
uncomfortable
feeling
in
her
chest
.

The
patient
was
treated
with
2
liters
of
intravenous
fluids
with
a
bump
in
her
systolic
blood
pressure
to
the
90
s.

Review
of
telemetry
revealed
an
8
to
9
beat
episode
of
nonsustained
ventricular
tachycardia
followed
by
an
episode
of
bradycardia
to
60
beats
per
minute
.

The
etiology
of
these
cardiovascular
episodes
was
unclear
,
but
was
felt
likely
secondary
to
the
patient
's
tenuous
cardiovascular
status
given
the
fact
that
she
had
clear
pulmonary
hypertension
,
was
very
preload
dependent
,
and
had
an
intact
left
ventricular
function
but
with
cardiac
output
limited
due
to
left
ventricular
compression
by
a
dilated
left
ventricle
.

Given
the
patient
's
persistent
hypotensive
episodes
,
and
decreased
urine
output
,
she
was
transferred
back
to
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
management
prior
to
initiation
of
Flolan
therapy
.

On
12-08
,
the
Hickman
catheter
was
placed
in
preparation
of
Flolan
administration
.

During
the
Mass.
Mental
Health
Center
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
stay
,
the
patient
was
found
to
exquisitely
preload
dependent
and
responded
well
to
aggressive
fluids
as
needed
to
maintain
her
blood
pressure
with
a
systolic
of
greater
than
90
.

She
had
no
further
episodes
of
bradycardia
during
her
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
stay
.

In
addition
,
the
patient
's
urine
output
improved
dramatically
with
hydration
therapy
,
suggesting
her
low
urine
output
was
secondary
to
decreased
cardiac
output
secondary
to
low
preload
.

The
patient
continued
to
be
followed
by
the
Electrophysiology
Service
,
who
determined
that
the
patient
was
demonstrating
severe
vasal
sensitivity
with
bradycardia
necessitating
pacemaker
placement
.

This
was
to
be
deferred
until
after
the
patient
had
her
Hickman
in
place
.

Because
the
patient
's
pulmonary
pressures
responded
so
well
to
adenosine
during
right
heart
catheterization
,
it
was
thought
that
the
patient
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
Flolan
therapy
.

Flolan
was
initiated
on
12-08
at
5
nanograms
per
kilogram
per
minute
.

The
patient
was
monitored
for
symptoms
of
Flolan
therapy
including
nausea
,
vomiting
,
first
bite
jaw
claudication
,
or
hypotension
.

Over
the
course
of
the
hospital
stay
the
patient
's
Flolan
dose
was
titrated
to
receive
maximum
benefit
without
precipitating
symptoms
of
Flolan
overdose
.

The
patient
was
felt
to
be
stable
on
her
current
Flolan
dose
and
was
therefore
transferred
back
to
the
floor
.

A
high
resolution
CT
was
requested
to
further
evaluate
for
possible
secondary
cause
of
her
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
;
however
,
the
patient
refused
it
at
this
time
.

Plans
for
placement
of
a
pacemaker
were
initiated
.

However
,
on
the
night
prior
to
the
planned
surgical
date
the
patient
suffered
an
episode
of
bleeding
from
her
Hickman
catheter
site
.

Surgery
was
notified
and
pressure
was
applied
;
however
,
it
did
not
stop
oozing
.

A
surgicel
dressing
was
placed
and
prolonged
pressure
resulted
in
resolution
of
the
bleeding
.

In
addition
,
an
extra
stitch
was
placed
in
an
effort
to
stop
the
bleeding
.

Following
this
episode
the
patient
felt
like
she
was
"
too
stressed
"
for
pacemaker
placement
.

Therefore
,
she
was
monitored
over
the
next
few
days
for
any
further
bleeding
events
.

Over
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
the
patient
became
more
accustomed
to
her
Flolan
,
and
Flolan
teaching
was
continued
.

She
continued
to
have
occasional
episodes
of
dizziness
,
shortness
of
breath
,
and
hypotension
whenever
the
alarm
sounded
suggesting
that
the
Flolan
bag
needed
to
be
changed
.

However
,
over
the
course
of
the
hospital
stay
these
decreased
both
in
frequency
and
severity
.

On
12-15
,
the
patient
went
for
placement
of
a
pacemaker
.

She
had
dual-mode
,
dual-pacing
,
dual-sensing
pacemaker
placed
with
a
lower
rate
at
60
ppm
,
and
upper
rate
of
120
ppm
with
a
paced
AV
of
150
msec
.

The
patient
recovered
well
from
her
surgery
for
pacemaker
placement
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
the
patient
was
tolerating
her
Flolan
therapy
well
.

She
had
received
a
full
course
of
Flolan
teaching
and
reported
that
she
and
her
husband
felt
comfortable
with
the
administration
of
the
medication
at
home
.

She
was
set
up
with
a
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
support
group
,
and
home
services
were
arranged
to
help
her
in
the
initiation
of
Flolan
therapy
.

Following
pacemaker
placement
the
patient
had
no
further
episodes
of
bradycardia
on
telemetry
,
and
therefore
she
was
discharged
in
satisfactory
condition
.

2.
INFECTIOUS
DISEASE
:

The
patient
had
no
signs
or
symptoms
of
infection
at
the
time
of
admission
.

However
,
she
was
noted
to
have
a
relatively
elevated
white
blood
cell
count
that
remained
stable
over
the
course
of
her
hospital
stay
.

However
,
near
the
end
of
her
hospitalization
the
patient
began
describing
increased
urinary
frequency
which
persisted
once
her
Foley
catheter
was
removed
.

A
urinalysis
was
positive
and
urine
culture
grew
enterococcus
which
was
pan
sensitive
.

Therefore
,
the
patient
was
started
on
levofloxacin
therapy
to
complete
a
10
-
day
course
.

Following
initiation
of
the
antibiotic
the
patient
's
white
blood
cell
count
quickly
came
down
,
and
she
remained
afebrile
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
the
patient
still
had
a
mildly
elevated
white
blood
cell
count
but
was
asymptomatic
with
a
normal
temperature
.

She
will
complete
two
more
days
of
Levaquin
therapy
as
an
outpatient
.

3.
RENAL
:

The
patient
's
BUN
and
creatinine
were
followed
over
the
course
of
her
hospital
stay
.

These
remained
stable
and
within
normal
limits
.

It
was
felt
that
the
decreased
urine
output
was
secondary
to
her
preload
dependence
,
and
that
her
urine
output
increased
significantly
when
she
was
adequately
hydrated
in
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

4.
GASTROINTESTINAL
:

The
patient
has
a
history
of
gastroesophageal
reflux

was
continued
on
Protonix
over
the
course
of
her
hospital
stay
and
had
no
further
gastrointestinal
issues
.

5.
HEMATOLOGY
:

The
patient
's
hematocrit
remained
stable
over
the
course
of
her
hospital
stay
.

Despite
bleeding
from
the
Hickman
site
,
she
did
not
require
any
transfusion
therapy
.

6.
FLUIDS
/
ELECTROLYTES
/
NUTRITION
:

The
patient
tolerated
a
regular
diet
throughout
the

stay
.

Her
electrolytes
were
checked
on
a
daily
basis
and
remained
within
normal
limits
,
being
replaced
as
needed
.

She
was
discharged
to
home
on
a
regular
diet
.

7.

a
history
of

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
is
a
56
-
year-old
man
without
any
significant
past
medical
history
who
presented
to
the
emergency
room
after
the
sudden
onset
of
headache
while
he
was
riding
a
bicycle
.

He
characterized
this
headache
as
the
worst
headache
of
his
life
and
had
associated
nausea
and
vomiting
times
one
.

He
also
complained
of
dizziness
at
the
time
of
headache
onset
.

He
presented
to
the
Edith
Nourse
Rogers
Memorial
VA
Hospital
emergency
room
,
where
an
initial
head
CT
scan
was
read
as
negative
.

However
,
a
lumbar
puncture
was
done
,
in
which
tube
1
showed
4800
red
blood
cells
and
tube
4
showed
4000
red
blood
cells
.

The
patient
was
sent
for
an
MRI
of
the
head
,
which
raised
the
question
of
a
right
posterior
cerebral
artery
aneurysm
.

The
CT
scan
was
revealed
and
,
on
second
analysis
,
it
was
thought

it
was
suspicious

hemorrhage
in
the
suprasellar
cistern
.

The
patient
was
then
admitted
for
further

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
47
year
old
patient
of
Dr.
Laymie
Fournier
and
Dr.
Leebjescobe
in
Co
In
Saorlirv
Frea
,
West
Virginia
who
was
well
until
a
bout
of
double
pneumonia
in
May
1992
,
at
which
time
he
was
hospitalized
at
Centdick
Naco
Hospital
Medical
Center
.

He
also
has
a
history
of
hypertension
and
diabetes
mellitus
.

He
had
a
transient
episode
of
headache
and
disorientation
at
that
time
.

A
CT
and
MRI
scan
corroborated
multiple
cerebral
infarcts
.

He
was
started
on
aspirin
.

He
has
a
family
history
of
hypertension
as
well
.

He
was
also
placed
on
Vasotec
.

A
Holter
monitor
showed
ventricular
ectopy
.

A
thallium
stress
test
showed
tachycardia
and
severe
dyspnea
as
well
as
a
fall
in
blood
pressure
with
low
level
exercise
.

An
echocardiogram
showed
global
hypokinesis
.

Accordingly
he
was
referred
for
further
evaluation
.

Hematocrit
on
admission
was
43%
with
a
white
blood
count
of
6600
.

MCV
was
85
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
taken
to
the
cardiac
catheterization
laboratory
,
where
he
was
noted
initially
to
have
a
pulmonary
wedge
pressure
of
45
with
a
pulmonary
artery
pressure
of
82/40
.

This
lowered
with
IV
nitroglycerin
.

Selective
coronary
angiography
showed
an
occluded
right
coronary
artery
in
its
midportion
.

He
had
an
80%
distal
left
main
,
a
90%
proximal
circumflex
,
and
multiple
significant
lesions
in
the
LAD
.

His
left
ventricle
ejection
showed
diffuse
hypokinesis
.

The
situation
was
reviewed
with
his
wife
,
Sligh
.

She
noted
that
he
was
actively
working
full
time
and
was
a
sales
representative
at
the
Leigh
and
lives
at
home
with
her
and
his
daughter
,
age
18
.

It
was
felt
that
,
because
of
the
evidence
of
congestive
heart
failure
and
the
critical
left
main
lesion
,
he
should
be
admitted
for
further
evaluation
.

Indeed
,
he
was
treated
with
diuretics
and
nitrates
along
with
cessation
of
his
aspirin
,
and
he
was
put
on
IV
Heparin
.

He
stabilized
over
the
weekend
.

He
was
noted
to
have
some
ventricular
ectopy
on
Holter
monitor
.

He
developed
epigastric
pain
on
07/31
which
previously
had
been
ignored
but
in
retrospect
was
probably
his
anginal
equivalent
.

He
also
had
multifocal
ventricular
ectopy
at
that
time
.

He
had
some
further
anterolateral
ST
segment
changes
.

Therefore
,
he
did
have
unstable
angina
with
his
critical
coronary
anatomy
.

The
patient
was
seen
in
consultation
by
the
Electrophysiology
service
,
Dr.
Slusslashgodle
,
who
said
that
he
had
no
indication
for
patch
placement
at
the
time
of
surgery
.

On
08/02/93
,
an
intra-aortic
balloon
pump
was
placed
;
then
,
Dr.
Thorebreutz
took
him
to
the
operating
room
,
where
he
had
quadruple
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
.

He
had
a
left
internal
mammary
artery
graft
of
the
LAD
,
a
single
saphenous
vein
to
the
right
coronary
artery
with
280
cc
per
minute
flow
,
and
a
saphenous
vein
snake
graft
to
the
diagonal
and
circumflex
with
150
cc
per
minute
flow
.

A
paraphimosis
was
noted
and
treated
by
Dr.
Ryna
Jescdrig
.

After
surgery
he
had
a
ongoing
sinus
tachycardia
.

He
was
able
to
be
rapidly
weaned
and
extubated
.

He
had
good
hemodynamics
.

He
had
occasional
atrial
and
ventricular
premature
beats
.

His
intra-aortic
balloon
pump
was
weaned
the
following
day
and
he
was
transferred
out
of
the
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

He
was
seen
in
consultation
by
the
Nutrition
Service
,
who
followed
him
for
dietary
management
of
his
diabetes
mellitus
.

On
08/05
it
was
noted
that
his
platelet
count
had
fallen
from
171,000
to
54,000
;
this
was
thought
to
be
associated
with
intravenous
Heparin
and
indeed
,
when
Heparin
was
discontinued
,
since
it
had
been
restarted
after
surgery
,
his
platelet
count
rebounded
to
normal
.

Therefore
,
he
does
have
a
thrombocytopenic
reaction
to
Heparin
.

He
remained
in
normal
sinus
rhythm
.

He
did
have
runs
of
nonsustained
ventricular
tachycardia
,
which
were
clinically
stable
.

He
had
a
right
bundle
branch
block
.

He
is
at
increased
risk
for
future
events
because
of
his
low
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
,
but
he
is
clinically
stable
on
ACE
inhibitors
,
Digoxin
,
Coumadin
,
and
aspirin
.

Therefore
he
was
able
to
be
discharged
home
.

He
understands
that
he
does
have
significant
left
ventricle
dysfunction
and
requires
monitoring
of
his
prothrombin
times
and
his
arrhythmias
;
these
will
be
done
in
Grovea
Co
Terburgperv
Portnew
.

History
of
Present
Illness
:

Ms.
Swanson
is
a
53
yo
woman
with
PMH
significant
for
seizure
disorder
,
brain
injury
,
and
?
atypical
multiple
sclerosis
who
presents
with
right
face
twitch
and
right
arm
shaking
.

History
is
obtained
from
her
sister
,
William
from
Lawrence
General
Hospital
,
and
from
her
primary
neurologist
,
Dr.
Brian
.

She
lives
in
an
assisted
living
,
and
was
noted
yesterday
to
have
generalized
tonic-clonic
activity
beginning
on
the
right
side
and
lasting
90
minutes
.

EMS
gave
her
valium
5
mg
pr
at
the
facility
and
brought
her
to
Barnstable
County
Hospital
.

She
persisted
with
right
sided
seizure
activity
there
and
was
given
valium
10
mg
and
ativan
1
mg
,
as
well
as
loaded
with
dilantin
1000
mg
.

She
was
transferred
to
the
Providence
Behavioral
Health
Hospital
CMED
.

Here
she
was
given
an
additional
valium
5
mg
x
2
and
ativan
1
mg
x
3
for
persistent
twitching
in
her
face
and
right
hand
.

Since
the
ativan
,
her
facial
twitching
has
apparently
improved
,
but
she
continues
to
have
hand
twitches
.

She
also
had
an
EEG
,
which
showed
left
sided
slowing
on
preliminary
read
.

Apparently
she
has
a
long
history
of
seizure
disorder
,
possibly
from
a
history
of
traumatic
brain
injury
(
though
per
Dr.
Paula
,

records
from
that
hospitalization
indicate
she
may
have
only
had
a
very
mild
injury
)
and
has
been
managed
on
dilantin
and
keppra
.

Since
she
has
seen
Dr.
Ollie
,
she
has
had
at
least
two
episodes
of
status
epilepticus
and
one
generalized
seizure
,
as
well
as
some
less
significant
seizures
which
are
characterized
by
left
gaze
preference
and
left
sided
tonic-clonic
activity
.

Her
dilantin
levels
had
been
somewhat
difficult
to
control
.

He
tried
adding
lamictal
,
but
this
caused
a
rash
.

At
the
time
of
her
last
visit
(
2015-03-18
)
Dr.
Bradley
had
discussed
the
addition
of
a
third
Castelluccio
,
possibly
zonegran
(
less
likely
topamax
),
to
the
dilantin
200
mg
bid
and
keppra
1500
mg
bid
.

Her
sister
had
wanted
to
keep
the
current
course
because
she
felt
she
was
doing
well
where
she
was
living
and
did
not
want
to
upset
that
.

However
,
she
had
several
dilantin
levels
drawn
since
her
last
visit
,
with
15.4
in
05
-
23.5
in
Theresa
,
and
3.09
-
18
.

Her
sister
reports
that
the
medication
dose
had
been
changed
to
200
mg
qam
and
100
mg
qpm
in
Theresa
,
and
a
review
of
her
Union
Hospital
-
North
Shore
Medical
Center
records
indicates
that
this
may
have
occurred
in
an
urgent
care
appointment
secondary
to
slurred
speech
and
a
recent
fall
and
a
non-trough
level
of
15.9
.

According
to
her
sister
,
the
patient
has
no
short-term
memory
.

She
has
been
living
in
an
assisted
living
facility
and
frequently
calls
her
even
right
after
she
has
left
without
remembering
her
visit
.

The
patient
walks
with
a
walker
at
baseline
and
goes
out
for
dinner
and
shopping
with
her
sister
.

Ms.
Swanson
also
carries
a
diagnosis
of
"
atypical
MS
",
which
she
brought
with
her
to
Dr.
Billie
.

According
to
Dr.
Nicole
,
she
has
had
stable
deficits
for
many
years
without
any
flare-like
episodes
.

She
had
an
MRI
in
2014
that
showed
multiple
plaque-like
lesions
,
but
these
were
entirely
stable
since
2010
.

She
is
not
undergoing
any
treatment
.

Reportedly
she
has
been
evaluated
at
Shriner's
Hospital
for
Crippled
Children
,
HealthSouth
Braintree
Rehab
Hospital
,
and
possibly
St.
Elizabeth's
Medical
Center
of
Boston
.

She
has
not
had
an
LP
as
far
as
Dr.
Ginger
knows
.

CT
HEAD
FINDINGS
:
There
is
moderately
severe
,
confluent
periventricular
white
matter
hypodensity
surrounding
the
frontal
horns
,
posterior
horns
,
and
more
superiorly
,
involving
the
centra
semiovale
.

These
findings
are
unchanged
from
prior
studies
,
and
may
relate
to
the
"
atypical
"
demyelinating
process
,
suggested
in
the
indication
on
the
prior
MRI
;
however
,
they
are
non-specific
.

There
is
no
evidence
of
acute
intra
-
or
extra
-
axial
hemorrhage
.

There
is
no
shift
of
normally
midline
structures
.

The
ventricles
are
mildly
prominent
,
but
are
unchanged
from
the
prior
study
.

There
is
no
interval
loss
of
focal
gray
-
white
matter
differentiation
to
suggest
acute
infarction
,
though
CT
is
not
sensitive
in
the
early
stages
.

No
focal
masses
is
seen
.

IMPRESSION
:

1)
No
intracranial
hemorrhage
or
mass
effect
;
no
significant
interval
change
from
CT
of
2015-07-20
.

2)
Diffuse
,
confluent
periventricular
white
matter
hypodensity
,
which
may
relate
to
an
underlying
demyelinating
process
(
as
suggested
in
the
indication
provided
for
the
prior
MRI
).

The
markedly
low
-
attenation
(
14-15
HU
)
centered
within
this
process
suggests
either
irreversible
demyelination
with
cavitation
("
black
hole
"),
or
lacunar
infarction
on
a
vascular
basis
.

Generalized
and
marked
callosal
atrophy
(
on
the
MR
)
also
suggest
advanced
,
irreversible
disease
.

3)
No
mass
is
appreciated
on
this
limited
non-contrast
study
;
if
clinically
concerned
,
an
MRI
with
gadolinium
is
recommended
.

MRI
:
There
is
a
similar
configuration
of
increased
T2
signal
in
the
periventricular
white
matter
of
both
cerebral
hemispheres
,
suggesting
demyelinating
disease
.

As
previously
noted
,
there
is
associated
volume
loss
,
thinning
of
the
corpus
callosum
,
and
slight
widening
of
the
ventricles
.

On
post-contrast
images
,
there
is
a
probably
stable
appearance
of
a
5
mm
linear
,
focal
area
of
enhancement
in
the
left
centrum
semiovale
,
of
uncertain
etiology
.

Also
ehancing
is
3
mm
linear
lesion
in
the
left
hippocampal
cortex
anteriorly
,
not
seen
on
the
08-20
MR
,
but
that
study
was
very
motion
-
degraded
.

The
hippocampus
would
be
a
most
unusual
site
for
involvement
by
multiple
sclerosis
.

There
is
no
apparent
mass
lesion
or
mass
effect
.

No
changes
in
the
overall
morphology
of
the
brain
are
identified
.

The
surrounding
osseous
and
soft
tissue
structures
are
unremarkable
.

The
major
vascular
flow
patterns
are
normal
.

IMPRESSION
:

1.
Stable
appearance
of
confluent
areas
of
increased
T2
signal
in
the
periventricular
white
matter
,
consistent
with
severe
demyelinating
disease
.

2.
Enhancing
lesions
in
the
left
centrum
semiovale
and
also
left
hippocampal
cortex
.

This
former
lesion
was
evident
on
MR
dating
back
to
2014-08-15
,
though
is
more
prominent
at
this
time
,
likely
due
to
less
motion
degradation
of
the
current
scan
.

Etiology
of
these
enhancing
lesions
is
uncertain
,
but
could
be
atypical
manifestations
of
demyelination
.

EEG
:

ABNORMALITY
#1:
Throughout
the
recording
there
were
frequent
bursts
of
generalized
theta
and
delta
slowing
.

Facial
twitching
was
described
by
the
technologist
and
seen
on
the
video
.

This
is
primarily
right-sided
,
facial
movement
clinically
and
did
not
appear
to
involve
the
forehead
or
CMED
CSRU
.

There
were
no
clear
EEG
correlate
.

ABNORMALITY
#2:
The
background
voltages
were
occasionally
lower
on
the
left
side
,
and
there
were
additional
bursts
of
delta
slowing
seen
broadly
on
the
left
side
alone
.

ABNORMALITY
#3:
The
background
rhythms
were
dominated
by
much
faster
beta
rhythm
.

They
appeared
to
reach
an
8
Hz
frequency
on
the
right
at
times
,
though
the
background
was
disorganized
and
slow
on
both
sides
for

much
of
the
recording
.

It
was
of
much
lower
voltage
on
the
left
.

HYPERVENTILATION
:
Could
not
be
performed
.

INTERMITTENT
PHOTIC
STIMULATION
:
Could
not
be
performed
.

SLEEP
:
No
normal
waking
or
sleeping
morphologies
were
seen
.

CARDIAC
MONITOR
:
Showed
a
generally
regular
rhythm
.

IMPRESSION
:
Abnormal
portable
EEG
due
to
the
bursts
of
generalized
slowing
and
additional
left-sided
slowing
and
voltage
dimunition
,
along
with
some
slowing
of
the
background
.

The
generalized
and
background
features
indicate
a
wide-spread
encephalopathy
.

The
left
sided
slowing
and
voltage
reduction
surpassed
an
additional
dysfunction
on
the
left
side
,
possibly
wide-spread
cortical
dysfunction
.

There
is
a
possibility
of
a
structural
lesion
on
the
left
,
but
the
encephalopathy
dominated
the
overall
picture
.

There
were
no
clear
epileptiform
discharges
.

No
EEG
correlate
was
established
for
the
facial
twitching
.

The
lack
of
EEG
correlate
to
the
facial
twitching
does
not
exclude
a
central
cause
(
and
,
indeed
,
this
appeared
most
likely
based
on
the
clinical
and
video
observations
).

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

53
yo
woman
with
h/o
seizure
disorder
,
demyelinating
disease
,
and
brain
injury
,
presents
with
prolonged
seizure
,
now
unresponsive
with
persistent
twitching
of
right
arm
and
face
.

This
is
most
consistent
with
complex
partial
seizures
with
a
focus
in
the
left
hemisphere
,
most
likely
the
motor
strip
.

In
the
past
,
her
seizures
were
on
the
left
side
,
which
implies
that
she
now
has
a
new
focus
.

It
is
possible
that
this
is
secondary
to
her
underlying
demyelinating
disease
,
but
per
report
this
has
not
been
very
active
.

Other
possibilities
include
infection
,
including
her
UTI
.

It
is
likely
that
these
seizures
began
due
to
subtherapeutic
dilantin
levels
on
her
new
dose
of
200
mg
/
100
mg
.

Her
seizure
management
is
difficult
,
given
the
higher
doses
were
causing
her
to
fall
and
slur
her
speech
.

Discussed
with
Dr.
Joaquin
the
addition
of
an
alternate
Castelluccio
with
the
possibility
of
tapering
down
the
dilantin
in
the
future
,
and
he
agreed
that
she
may
benefit
from
zonegran
.

Cannot
use
lamictal
or
depakote
due
to
reactions
.

Topamax
is
another
possibility
,
but
not
ideal
in
a
patient
with
preexisting
cognitive
deficits
.

She
was
started
on
zonegran
at
50
mg
daily
with
plans
to
increase
by
50
mg
every
other
week
to
a
goal
dose
of
200
mg
/
day
;
she
was
on
100
mg
daily
at
discharge
and
should
have
her
dose
increased
on
10-12
and
again
on
10-26
.

She
was
continued
on
keppra
and
dilantin
with
trough
checked
frequently
and
adjustment
as
needed
.

Ativan
was
used
for
breakthrough
seizures
(
facial
twitching
).

MRI/MRA
showed
new
temporal
lesions
,
but
it
is
unclear
if
these
are
the
cause
or
effect
of
her
seizures
.

She
will
need
to
have
a
repeat
MRI
in
several
months
for
further
evaluation
.

LP
was
done
and
had
no
changes
to
suggest
a
different
etiology
(
ie
negative
cytology
and
negative
immunophenotyping
).

Oligoclonal
bands
were
not
assessed
as
there
was
not
enough
CSF
per
the
laboratory
.

She
will
need
repeated
dilantin
troughs
with
one
time
dose
when
trough
is
subtherapeutic
.

atypical
MS
:
discussed
with
her
outpt
neurologist
(
Dr.
Ford
in
Boston
Medical
Center
);
no
current
role
for
MS
medications
.

MRI
was
performed
and
showed
new
lesions
vs
sz
effects
in
the
left
temporal
lobe
.

She
also
had
a
new
lesion
on
her
last
MRI
in
the
centrum
semiovale
.

LP
was
done
to
evaluate
for
malignancy
,
and
no
malignant
cells
were
seen
.

Immunotyping
was
negative
as
well
(
per
verbal
report
).

Unfortunately
,
oligoclonal
bands
could
not
be
sent
from
the
CSF
(
lab
sent
CSF
for
other
studies
and
there
was
not
enough
left
over
for
OCB
s).

This
was
relayed
to
the
family
(
Kirk
).

Given
that
she
does
have
new
lesions
on
MRI
,
if
OCB
s
were
sent
this
would
have
weighed
in
in
her
dx
of
MS
,
and
it's
possible
she
could
benefit
from
MS
therapy
.

This
was
relayed
to
the
family
,
and
they
will
readdress
this
with
Dr.
Ford
(
MS
Hoyos
).

The
family
is
confident
in
any
decision
Dr.
Ford
would
make
re
:
therapy
for
her
MS
.

ADMISSION
DIAGNOSIS
:

VULVAR
CANCER
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
43-year-old
gravida
II
para
II
white
female
referred
by
Dr.
Ca
Shuff
for
evaluation
.

She
was
in
her
usual
state
of
good
health
until
December
when
she
was
seen
emergently
for
treatment
of
a
perforated
colon
cancer
.

That
area
was
resected
with
no
evidence
of
metastatic
disease
.

She
has
had
subsequent
CEA&apos;s
and
scans
which
were
negative
.

A
tumor
was
noted
on
her
vulva
which
was
biopsied
and
revealed
squamous
cell
carcinoma
in
situ
.

ALLERGIES
:

NO
KNOWN
DRUG
ALLERGIES
.

MEDICATIONS
:

None
.

PAST
SURGICAL
HISTORY
:

As
above
with
colostomy
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

On
admission
included
HEENT
exam
which
was
normal
.

Chest
was
clear
.

Heart
revealed
a
regular
rate
and
rhythm
.

Abdomen
was
soft
and
nontender
.

Vulva
and
right
labia
replaced
by
reddish
lesion
,
somewhat
raised
in
the
center
extending
from
adjacent
to
the
cuterus
to
the
posterior
forchette
.

Otherwise
,
her
pelvic
exam
was
negative
.

IMPRESSION
:

STAGE
II
SQUAMOUS
CELL
CARCINOMA
OF
THE
VULVA
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
plan
was
for
right
radical
vulvectomy
.

1.
Vulvectomy
:

The
patient
on
2/8/90
underwent
a
right
radical
vulvectomy
with
excellent
results
and
negative
margins
on
frozen
section
.

Her
postoperative
course
was
unremarkble
.

She
was
kept
on
bedrest
for
two
days
and
then
was
ambulating
and
voiding
well
without
trouble
on
postoperative
day
number
three
when
the
Foley
catheter
was
discontinued
.

She
has
been
doing
Betadine
paint
and
blow
drying
the
area
several
times
a
day
and
after
each
bowel
movement
and
urine
without
incident
.

DISPOSITION
:

The
discharge
is
to
home
.

The

and
cardiac
apex
.

His
ejection
fraction
however
appeared
preserved
at
73%
with
mild
inferior
wall
hypokinesis
.

Subsequent
cardiac
catheterization
at

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Mr.
Chester
was
admitted
to
the
cardiac
surgical
service
and
underwent
routine
preoperative
evaluation
.

He
remained
pain
free
on
medical
therapy
.

Workup
was
unremarkable
and
he
was
cleared
for
surgery
.

On
04-18
,
Dr.
Oneill
performed
off
pump
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
.

For
surgical
details
,
please
see
seperate
dictated
operative
note
.

Following
the
operation
,
he
was
brought
to
the
CSRU
for
invasive
monitoring
.

Within
24
hours
,
he
awoke
neurologically
intact
and
was
extubated
without
incident
.

Given
hypotension
and
bradycardia
,
he
was
slow
to
wean
from
Neosynephrine
.

Low
dose
beta
blockade
was
eventually
resumed
.

Chest
tubes
and
pacing
wires
were
removed
without
complication
.

On
postoperative
day
three
,
he
transferred
to
the
SDU
.

He
maintained
a
normal
sinus
rhythm
without
atrial
or
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

He
remained
in
sinus
bradycardia
(
rate
50-60
)
and
tolerated
low
dose
beta
blockade
.

On
POD
#6
his
creatinine
became
slightly
elevated
at
1.4
,
his
lasix
was
discontinued
and
the
following
day
his
creatinine
was
stable
at
1.4
.

He
continued
to
progress
and
was
eventually
cleared
for
discharge
to
home
on
postoperative
day
7
.

His
discharge
chest
x-ray
showed
persistent
bibasilar
atelectasis
with
only
tiny
pleural
effusions
.

Of
note
,
he
will
need
to
remain
on
Plavix
for
three
months
postop
given
the
off
pump
procedure
.

In
addition
,
he
will
need
to
remain
on
Imdur
given
use
of
his
right
internal
mammary
artery
as
a
"
free
"
arterial
graft
in
preventing

vasospasm
.

-
She
was
admitted
to
the
CMED
CSRU
for
her
repiratory
failure
which
was
thought
to
be
secondary
to
CHF
.

Pt
was
diuresed
with
iv
lasix
/
acetazolamide
and
given
iv
morphine
/
prn
for
respiratory
distress
and
BIPAP
was
tried
.

However
,
hypercarbia
(
04-11
metabolic
alkalosis
)
remained
in
the
90s
.

Pt
was
mentating
okay
,
having
conversations
with
intermittent
somnolence
despite
hypercarbia
.

TTE
showed
preserved
EF
with
moderate

.

Cardiology
was
consulted
and
thought
MS
Harold
Holcomb
to
her

and
pulm
HTN
.

Cardiology
recommended
d/cing
digoxin
and
starting
amiodarone

For
possible

,
pt
was
started
on

.

Pt
is
currently
satting
90s
on

but
needs
more
O2
when
supine
.

Pt
is
a
mouth

and
occasionally
needs
a

.

Pt
will
need
I/Os
monitored
to
goal
even

as
she
was
diursed
4.8

during
her
CMED
stay
.

Depending
on
her
I/O
,
lasix
and
acetazolamide
can
be
decreased
or
discontinued
.

If
she
were
to
decompensate
at

will
need
to
be

is
an
86
year
old
female
,
previously
healthy
,
who
presents
with
a
3
month
history
of
dysphagia
.

A
subsequent
workup
including
upper
gastrointestinal
series
and
abdominal
computerized
tomography
scan
suggested
the
presence
of
a
gastric
mass
.

Endoscopy
with
biopsy
revealed
gastric
carcinoma
,
poorly
differentiated
,
within
the
body
of
the
stomach
along
the
greater
curvature
.

She
was
subsequently
referred
to
Dr.
Ko
for
a
possible
resection
of
this
carcinoma
.

She
reports
a
10
pound
weight
loss
over
the
past
several
months
.

She
denies
any
abdominal
pain
.

PAST
MEDICAL
HISTORY
:

She
denies
any
history
of
hypertension
,
diabetes
mellitus
,
coronary
artery
disease
or
peptic
ulcer

father
died
of
stomach
carcinoma
.

She
is
a
former
smoker
,
and
drinks
alcohol
occasionally
.

.

Her
neck
was
supple
without
masses
or
bruits
noted
.

Her
lungs
were
clear
to
auscultation
.

Her
cardiac
examination
was
unremarkable
.

her
abdomen
revealed
a
flat
nontender
abdomen
without
palpable
masses
.

There
were
multiple
well
healed
surgical
scars
.

She
was
guaiac
negative
.

There
was
no
cva
tenderness
or
spinal
tenderness
noted
.

Her
pulses
were
intact
throughout
.

LABORATORY
DATA
:

Sodium
139
,
potassium
3.7
and
BUN
of
19
.

Her
hematocrit
was
37.2
with
a
white
blood
count
of
6.6
.

Her
Bilirubin
direct
and
total
were
0.1
and
0.3
respectively
.

Her
alkaline
phosphatase
was
134
.

Her
electrocardiogram
demonstrated
normal
sinus
rhythm
without
acute
ischemic
changes
.

Chest
X-Ray
was
unremarkable
.

The
assessment
at
the
time
of
admission
was
that
of
an
86
year
old
female
with
poorly
differentiated
gastric
adenocarcinoma
,
admitted
for
resection
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Service
of
Dr.
Fede
A.
Duhenile
.

On
1/12/92
she
was
taken
to
the
operating
room
where
she
underwent
a
neart
total
gastrectomy
with
a
retrocolic
Bill-Roth
II
gastrojejunostomy
reconstruction
.

In
addition
a
small
ventral
hernia
was
noted
upon
abdominal
exploration
within
a
previous
surgical
incision
.

This
was
repaired
.

A
needle
jejunostomy
catheter
was
placed
at
the
time
of
her
operation
to
facilitate
postoperative
nutrition
.

With
regards
to
the
cancer
,
there
was
a
large
mass
along
the
greater
curvature
in
the
body
of
the
stomach
,
and
several
perigastric
lymph
nodes
which
were
taken
with
the
specimen
.

In
addition
,
there
were
at
least
two
lymph
nodes
within
the
porta
hepatis
which
were
dissected
free
and
taken
en
bloc
with
the
specimen
.

The
remainder
of
her
abdomen
was
unremarkable
without
evidence
of
metastatic
spread
elsewhere
,
including
the
liver
.

The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
well
and
was
taken
to
the
recovery
room
in
good
condition
.

The
patient
's
postoperative
course
was
for
the
most
part
unremarkable
.

Her
wounds
healed
well
without
incident
and
the
needle
jejunostomy
tube
was
utilized
on
the
first
postoperative
day
right
up
until
the
time
of
discharge
,
infusing
Vivonex
T.E.N.

The
patient
tolerated
this
without
difficulty
.

The
patient
's
nasogastric
tube
was
removed
on
the
3rd
postoperative
day
,
and
with
the
passage
of
flatus
and
good
bowel
sounds
noted
,
she
was
started
on
a
liquid
diet
which
was
advanced
slowly
.

She
was
seen
by
the
dietician
and
was
advised
with
regard
to
needing
numerous
small
meals
during
the
day
rather
than
3
larger
meals
as
she
previously
was
used
to
.

Her
ambulation
and
mobilization
increased
gradually
and
by
the
time
of
discharge
she
was
walking
in
the
halls
without
assistance
.

As
mentioned
,
her
wounds
healed
well
without
incident
and
the
staples
were
removed
on
the
10th
postoperative
day
just
prior
to
discharge
.

She
had
some
difficulties
with
confusion
in
the
early
postoperative
period
which
were
attributable
to
her
advanced
age
and
a
sundowning
effect
.

These
problems
resolved
by
the
4th
or
5th
postoperative
day
and
she
remained
lucid
and
alert
for
the
remainder
of
her
hospital
stay
.

Surgical
pathology
report
was
completed
prior
to
discharge
which
revealed
poorly
differentiated
adenocarcinoma
ulcerating
and
extending
through
the
wall
into
the
serosa
of
the
stomach
.

Metastatic
carcinoma
was
present
in
3
of
3
lymph
nodes
.

The
gastric
resection
margins
were
free
of
carcinoma
.

The
patient
was
set
for
discharge
on
the
11th
postoperative
day
doing
well
.

On
the
day
prior
to
discharge
she
complained
of
some
dysuria
,
a
urine
specimen

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
was
a
53-year-old
male
with
a
longstanding
history
of
renal
disease
with
multiple
complications
and
problems
related
to
vascular
access
and
hypercoagulable
state
.

These
culminated
in
an
attempted
cadaveric
kidney
transplant
undertaken
on
12/16/97
,
which
was
complicated
by
thrombosis
and
necrosis
of
the
cadaveric
renal
vein
within
24
hours
.

This
required
a
transplant
nephrectomy
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
AND
TREATMENT
:

The
patient
&apos;s
course
was
subsequently
characterized
by
recurrent
pneumonias
,
possibly
due
to
aspiration
,
and
by
hemodynamic
instability
.

He
was
transferred
to
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
from
the
Transplant
Service
for
ventilatory
management
in
the
setting
of
hypotension
.

On
transfer
,
the
patient
was
not
sedated
,
but
was
unresponsive
and
extremely
dyssynchronous
with
the
ventilator
.

The
patient
was
found
to
have
substantial
auto
PEEP
with
an
elevated
dead
space
.

A
pulmonary
arteriogram
on
01/03/98
demonstrated
multiple
pulmonary
emboli
,
likely
less
than
one
week
old
,
possibly
introduced
at
the
time
of
the
renal
vein
thrombosis
of
12/19/97
.

An
inferior
vena
cava
filter
was
placed
;
lower
extremity
noninvasive
studies
were
negative
.

The
patient
required
high
pressures
to
ventilate
adequately
,
possibly
related
to
an
abdominal
compartment
syndrome
.

The
patient
had
undergone
two
abdominal
procedures
following
explantation
.

The
physiology
at
the
time
of
transfer
to
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
was
consistent
with
a
septic
process
.

CT
scan
demonstrated
retroperitoneal
collection
containing
both
free
air
and
extravasated
contrast
material
.

For
the
concern
of
a
perforated
viscus
,
the
patient
was
taken
to
exploratory
laparotomy
on
01/06/98
,
during
which
the
bowel
was
run
without
evidence
of
perforation
.

The
patient
remained
unstable
.

He
was
taken
to
fluoroscopy
,
where
oral
contrast
was
demonstrated
to
be
extravasating
through
a
posterior
duodenum
.

For
this
reason
,
he
was
taken
again
to
the
operating
room
on
01/08/98
,
at
which
time
a
gastrojejunostomy
was
performed
with
stapling
across
the
gastroduodenal
junction
,
introduction
of
five
Jackson-Pratt
drains
into
the
retroperitoneal
mass
,
cholecystotomy
tube
,
gastrostomy
tube
,
and
jejunostomy
tube
.

The
patient
had
an
extensive
estimated
blood
loss
requiring
multiple
blood
products
and
fluid
resuscitation
therapy
.

Accompanying
this
during
this
period
were
elevations
in
liver
function
studies
and
amylase
and
lipase
consistent
with
pancreatic
inflammation
.

The
patient
was
aggressively
treated
with
fluid
resuscitation
and
pressors
for
his
septic
physiology
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
cardiac
tamponade
or
specific
underlying
coronary
dysfunction
.

He
was
treated
with
appropriate
antibiotics
for
his
Serratia
pneumonia
,
as
well
as
for
his
abdominal
process
.

The
patient
was
felt
to
have
an
underlying
hypercoagulable
state
,
thought
to
be
the
source
for
the
repeated
clots
.

Because
of
the
bleeding
problems
,
however
,
it
was
felt
that
full
heparinization
would
not
be
prudent
,
and
the
patient
was
treated
with
pneumo-boots
and
subcutaneous
heparin
.

Attention
was
paid
to
a
variety
of
metabolic
and
electrolyte
abnormalities
,
which
were
corrected
appropriately
.

Nonetheless
,
Mr.
Less
continued
to
remain
critically
ill
with
only
very
transient
mild
improvement
with
drainage
of
additional
retroperitoneal
fluid
.

He
remained
pressor
dependent
,
as
well
as
dependent
upon
mechanical
ventilatory
assistance
.

His
course
was
complicated
by
atrial
fibrillation
requiring
cardioversion
.

He
had
an
ongoing
requirement
for
high
volume
resuscitation
and
was
persistently
acidotic
despite
CV-VVH
in
the
face
of
bicarbonate
replenishment
.

The
patient
also
appeared
to
have
stool
from
his
Jackson-Pratt
site
and
right
oblique
incision
.

Bloody
drainage
from
his
increasingly
distended
abdomen
was
noted
.

Extensive
discussions
were
carried
out
with
Mrs.
Less
condition
was
irretrievable
.

It
was
felt
that
the
patient
had
continued
massive
retroperitoneal
contamination
and
probable
multiple
enteric
fistulae
from
an
ischemic
bowel
.

Dr.
Cantsleddjesc
felt
that
no
surgical
approach
to
this
problem
or
further
intervention
or
radiologic
procedures
would
be
helpful
.

All
physicians
and
the
family
were
in
agreement
that
the
most
appropriate
approach
was
to
institute
comfort
measures
.

This
was
done
,
and
the
patient
appeared
to
be
comfortable
at
the
time
of
death
with
his
family
at
his
side
on
1/16/98
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
Nantucket
Cottage
Hospital
on
2013-03-27
following
a
motor
vehicle
crash
as
described
previously
.

Chest
and
pelvis
X-rays
were
negative
for
fractures
.

A
CT
of
her
head
demonstrated
intraparenchymal
and
extraaxial
blood
(
mostly
subarachnoid
)
in
bilateral
cerebral
hemispheres
,
right
greater
than
left
,
in
a
pattern
indicating
contrecoup
injury
.

A
CT
of
her
C-spine
revealed
a
possible
fracture
of
right
C7
pedicle
.

A
CT
of
her
chest
revealed
bliateral
lung
nodules
and
a
right
thyroid
nodule
.

A
CT
of
her
sinues
revealed
no
fractures
.

X-rays
of
her
right
lower
extremity
were
negative
for
any
acute
injury
.

A
neurosurgery
consult
was
obtained
.

Our
recommendations
were
to
load
her
with
Dilantin
and
then
continue
at
100
mg
PO
TID
.

The
orthopedics
spine
service
saw
her
and
put
her
in
a
C-collar
.

She
was
admitted
to
the
trauma
ICU
.

A
repeat
head
CT
12
hours
after
the
first
was
largely
unchanged
.

She
was
transferred
to
step
down
.

She
was
having
some
pain
issues
and
morphine
was
making
her
"
jittery
."

On
HD
2
she
was
switched
to
Fioricet
,
which
helped
with
her
headaches
.

A
repeact
head
CT
was
unchanged
.

An
MRI
of
her
C-spine
was
done
to
evaluate
for
ligamentous
injury
,
but
this
was
extremely
limited
examination
due
to
patient
motion
and
the
signal
in
the
spinal
cord
could
not
be
adequately
assessed
for
edema
.

As
per
CMED
CSRU
spine
,
the
patient
was
instructed
to
follow-up
in
2
weeks
for
repeat
X-rays
.

On
discharge
she
was
awake
,
alert
and
orientated
X3
with
c/o
mild
headache
.

She
had
full
strength
motor
exam
,
no
pronator
drift
and
PERRLA
with
full
EOM
s.

She
was
ambulating
without
difficulties
.

On
04-01
she
was
seen
by
physical
therapy
was
thought
to
benefit
from
acute
rehabilitation
.

She
had
a
head
CT
prior
to
discharge
that
showed
resolution
of
the
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
.

Follow-up
in
1
month
with
neurosurgery
for
a
repeat
head
CT
was
arranged
.

She
was
discharged
on
fioricet
and
dilantin
.

She
was
counseled
to
follow-up
with
her
PCP
F
6-12
months
regading
the
right
thyroid
nodule
and
the
bilateral
small
lung
nodules
seen
on
her
chest
CT
.

Neurologically
intact
.

LABORATORY
DATA
:

bilirubin
to
be
.6
.

SGOT
of
80
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Preoperatively
,
the
patient
underwent
chemo-embolization
for
his
hepatocellular
carcinoma
.

The
remainder
of
his
preoperative
course
was
benign
.

On
July
15
,
1992
,
a
liver
became
available
,
and
the
patient
underwent
hepatectomy
and
orthotopic
liver
transplant
.

His
operation
was
complicated
by
severe
coagulopathy
requiring
fifty-nine
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
,
64
units
of
FFP
and
34
units
of
platelets
.

Postoperatively
,
the
patient
continued
to
have
a
coagulopathy
requiring
re-exploration
on
postoperatively
day
2
,
with
findings
only
of
hematoma
and
no
active
bleeding
.

Initially
,
the
patient
did
well
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
,
mentally
alert
,
and
oriented
,
however
,
he
continued
to
be
coagulopathic
and
was
requiring
large
amounts
of
blood
and
FFP
transfusions
,
with
a
resultant
pulmonary
edema
.

He
developed
renal
failure
felt
to
be
ATN
secondary
to
ischemia
of
his
kidneys
.

The
patient
remained
intubated
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
twelve
days
prior
to
his
death
.

He
had
daily
transfusions
of
FFP
and
blood
,
and
continued
coagulopathy
.

He
also
developed
thrombocytopenia
,
requiring
persistent
platelet
transfusions
on
a
daily
basis
.

His
immunosuppression
was
OKT3
and
Solu
Medrol
,
and
he
underwent
hemodialysis
and
ultra
filtration
to
remove
fluid
.

While
in
the
ICU
he
developed
seizures
,
requiring
large
amounts
of
intravenous
Valium
to
break
his
seizures
,
and
he
was
maintained
on
Tegretol
and
Dilantin
.

However
,
he
became
progressively
more
mentally
obtunded
.

During
the
seizure
,
he
bit
his
tongue
,
resulting
in
a
large
bleed
from
his
tongue
,
which
was
sutured
by
the
ENT
Service
,
however
,
his
continued
coagulopathy
resulted
in
bleeding
from
his
nasopharynx
,
which
could
never
be
identified
,
and
also
upper
gastrointestinal
bleeding
.

Endoscopy
never
revealed
specific
sources
of
bleeding
,
although
he
appeared
to
have
a
diffuse
duodenitis
.

He
was
started
on
Pitressin
to
try
to
control
the
gastrointestinal
bleeding
,
but
he
continued
to
have
severe
bleeding
,
and
became
progressively
hypotensive
,
with
eventual
bradycardia
and
cardiac
arrest
.

He
was
pronounced
dead
at
3:49
PM
on
July
15
,
1992
.

He
previously
underwent
bronchoscopy
with
washings
which
showed
to
be
negative
for
malignant
cells
and
showed
atypical
bronchial
epithelial
cells
,
likely
to
be
reactive

taken
to
the
Operating
Room
the
day
of
admission
.

He
underwent
a
left
bronchoscopy
and
lower
lobectomy
of
the
left
side
.

The
operation
was
subsequently
complicated
by
a
postoperative
bleeding
.

The
patient
had
to
be
taken
back
to
the
Operating
Room
where
a

HISTORY
:

Patient
is
a
73-year-old
retired
cook
with
a
history
of
cervical
myelopathy
,
who
is
admitted
for
new
left
hemiparesis
.

He
had
undergone
C-spine
surgery
for
spinal
stenosis
with
a
question
of
myelopathy
and
radiculopathy
in
1992
with
residual
spastic
paresis
and
monoparesis
of
the
left
upper
extremity
,
but
was
ambulatory
until
a

to
admission
.

At
his
baseline
,
he
was
able
to
perform
limited
tasks
with
his
left
upper
extremity
,
and
was
clearly
able
to
move
his
hand
and
able
to
ambulate
.

He
also
at
baseline
has
had
urinary
and
fecal
urgencies
/
incontinence
.

His
history
is
now
that
he
has
had
a
week
of
progressive
left
upper
extremity
weakness
,
to
the
point
of
being
unable
to
move
the
left
hand
and
one
day
of
being

HOSPITAL
COURSE
AND
TREATMENT
:

Mr.
Finger
was
admitted
for
what
appeared
to
be
a
stroke
syndrome
involving
his
left
middle
cerebral
artery
territory
.

He
underwent
neurovascular
doppler
studies
which
showed
no
significant
change
in
either
common
carotid
or
in
the
left
common
internal
ophthalmic
system
.

However
,
there
were
hemodynamic
changes
which
raised
the
question
of
right
siphon
disease
.

He
had
normal
cervical
vertebral
arteries
.

Transcranial
dopplers
showed
no
abnormalities
in
the
ophthalmic
siphon
systems
,
distal
vertebrals
,
or
proximal
basilar
artery
.

The
proximal
,
middle
,
anterior
and
posterior
cerebral
arteries
,
however
,
could
not
be
insinuated
.

Over
the
course
of
the
first
hospital
day
,
the
patient
&apos;s
exam
deteriorated
in
a
manner
that
appeared
to
be
blood
pressure
dependent
.

He
had
been
started
on
Heparin
from
the
time
of
his
admission
.

A
computerized
tomography
scan
had
showed
multiple
lacunes
,
right
greater
than
left
,
and
the
deep
gray
and
white
matters
suspicious
for
proximal
middle
cerebral
artery
stem
occlusion
or
stenosis
.

MRI
/
MRA
was
performed
with
diffusion
weighted
images
,
showing
subcortical
white
matter
and
basal
ganglia
infarcts
,
but
preserved
middle
cerebral
artery
territory
cortex
.

Because
of
his
blood
pressure
,
dependence
of
his
left
sided
extremities
,
the
lower
leg
specifically
,
he
was
transferred
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
where
he
underwent
hypertensive
therapy
for
several
days
.

His
systolic
blood
pressure
goal
was
initially
170-190
,
which
he
was
able
to
achieve
spontaneously
for
the
most
part
.

However
,
due
to
the
absence
of
clear
benefit
at
this
level
,
and
further
deterioration
in
his
left
sided
strength
,
this
goal
was
increased
and
Neo-Synephrine
was
added
to
his
regimen
to
achieve
mean
arterial
pressures
in
the
110-120
range
.

This
strategy
and
its
incumbent
risks
,
particularly
in
a
patient
on
Heparin
,
were
discussed
at
length
with
both
the
patient
and
his
family
,
who
were
very
clear
in
wanting
to
proceed
with
all
possible
efforts
to
save
the
use
of
his
left
leg
.

While
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
,
his
strength
deteriorated
from
being
able
to
hold
his
left
leg
off
the
bed
up
to
several
inches
to
loosing
virtually
all
distal
extremity
strength
,
and
having
a
2-3/5
power
in
his
proximal
left
leg
groups
.

He
also
,
as
Neo-Synephrinewas
tapered
,
developed
mild
sensory
findings
,
in
particular
diminished
large
fiber
sensibility
in
his
left
hand
,
although
he
at
times
,
including
near
the
end
of
his
Intensive
Care
Unit
stay
had
a
right
gaze
preference
.

In
terms
of
exploring
his
visual
space
,
he
was
able
to
look
to
the
left
,
and
it
was
not
possible
to
elicit
clear
evidence
for
a
field
deficit
.

He
was
followed
by
speech
and
swallowing
service
,
who
assisted
in
the
management
of
po
intake
which
gradually
improved
,
although
he
clearly
had
problems
with
manipulation
of
food
in
the
left
side
of
his
mouth
and
would
tend
to
accumulate
a
pouch
of
food
in
his
left
cheek
.

I
should
mention
that
his
blood
pressure
therapy
was
at
times
limited
by
a
severe
headache
,
although
he
also
had
this
off
the
pressor
.

He
had
several
repeat
imaging
studies
during
his
Intensive
Care
Unit
stay
which
showed
further
demarcation
,
but
not
extension
of
his
prior
infarct
,
both
on
computerized
tomography
scan
and
DWI
images
.

Additionally
,
he
had
a
perfusion
,
diffusion
MR
study
earlier
on
,
which
suggested
the
presence
of
viable
penumbra
,
including
the
overlying
cortex
.

He
was
transferred
to
the
regular
neurology
floor
once
it
became
clear
that
he
was
not
receiving
any
significant
benefit
from
hypertensive
therapy
.

At
this
time
,
his
neurologic
exam
is
notable
for
hemiplegia
of
his
left
arm
,
severe
hemiparesis
of
his
left
leg
,
mild
large
fiber
sensory
loss
in
his
left
arm
,
and
otherwise
fairly
intact
mental
status
,
cranial
nerve
function
,
and
right
sided
motor
and
sensory
function
.

We
anticipate
that
he
represents
a
good
rehab
potential
.

He
will
be
discharged
to
rehab
on
a
regimen
of
Coumadin

HISTORY
OF
THE
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Mrs.
Gonzalez
is
a
patient
with
a
prior
medical
history
including
hypothyroidism
,
iron-deficiency
anemia
,
osteoporosis
,
increased
cholesterol
,
peptic
ulcer
disease
,
chronic
constipation
,
and
status
post
appendectomy
as
well
as
status
post
hysterectomy
and
bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy
.

She
was
transferred
from
an
outside
hospital
for
evaluation
and
treatment
of
adenocarcinoma
involving
the
transverse
colon
and
gallbladder
.

At
the
outside
hospital
the
patient
had
already
seemed
some
workup
for
a
couple
weeks
duration
of
bilateral
upper
quadrant
pain
which
occasionally
radiated
to
her
back
.

She
was
also
complaining
of
fatigue
for
two
weeks
but
a
good
appetite
and
the
patient
denied
weight
loss
,
melena
,
or
bright
red
blood
per
rectum
.

A
CAT
scan
of
the
abdomen
showed
air-fluid
levels
in
the
gallbladder
.

It
also
showed
a
thickened
gallbladder
wall
as
well
as
a
dilated
common
bile
duct
.

Incidentally
,
it
also
showed
diverticulosis
.

A
HIDA
scan
at
the
other
hospital
did
not
show
filling
of
the
gallbladder
indicating
some
sort
of

cystic
duct
obstruction
.

The
first
imaging
study
that
was
done
at
Hahnemann
General
Hospital
was
a
MRCP
which
revealed
an
enhanced
thickened
gallbladder
wall
consistent
with
chronic
cholecystitis
.

A
differential
according
to
the
imaging
included
a
fistula
with
adjacent
inflammatory
change
but
also
carcinoma
or
adenomatosis
.

In
addition,
also
the
MRCP
showed
a
mass
near
the
region
of
the
neck
of
the
gallbladder
.

Of
note
,
at
the
outside
hospital
,
an
endoscopy
and
colonoscopy
were
performed
.

The
colonoscopy
showed
two
polyps
and
also
a
region
in
the
transverse
colon
that
was
biopsied
.

This
biopsy
came
back
as
positive
for
adenocarcinoma
.

The
diagnosis
of
adenocarcinoma
was
already
established
prior
to
her
admission
at
this
hospital
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
scheduled
for
an
operative
date
on
2014-07-29
and
over
the
next
few
days
she
was

given
a
low-residual
diet
.

She
had
her
belly
cleaned
with
Hibiclens
one
a
day
and
once
an
adequate
preoperative
evaluation
was
performed
,
she
was
given
a
bowel
prep
on
Monday
afternoon
and
evening
in
preparation
for
an

exploratory
laparotomy
on
Tuesday
,
2014-07-29
.

On
the
morning
of
2014-07-29
,
the
patient
was
taken
to
the
Operating
Room
and
underwent
a
cholecystectomy
,
partial
hepatectomy
,
partial
lymph
node
dissection
,
a
colocolostomy
,
partial
colectomy
,
and
in
addition
a
gastrostomy
and
a
feeding
jejunostomy
were
also
put
in
place
.

Please
refer
to
the
previously
dictated
operative
notes
for
the
details
of
this
surgery
.

Briefly
,
the
surgery
on
2014-07-29
revealed
a
carcinoma
of
the
gallbladder
with
a
cholecystocolonic
fistula
which
crossed
into
the
liver
as
well
as
metastatic
adenopathy
around
the
portal
nodes
as
well
as
retroperitoneal
nodes
around
the
inferior
vena
cava
and
the
hepatic
artery
.

In
addition
to
the
gastrostomy
and
feeding
jejunostomy
tube
,
two
Belmont-Gardner
drains
were
placed
.

The
patient
's
pain
postoperatively
was
controlled
with
an
epidural
catheter
.

However
,
the
epidural
had
the
consequence
of
causing
a
bit
of
a
hypotension
in
the
patient
and
the
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Surgical
ICU
for
the
first
postoperative
day
.

In
addition
,
the
patient
had
low
hematocrits
which
required
a
transfusion
of
packed
red
blood
cells
.

In
addition
,
on
postoperative
day
number
two
,
the
patient
was
transferred
out
to
the
floor
and
she
was
doing
better
in
terms
of
pain
control
on
a
Dilaudid
PCA
machine
.

On
postoperative
day
number
two
,
interestingly
,
the
patient
was
complaining
of
sensitivity
to
light
from
an
unknown
etiology
.

The
patient
's
postoperative
course
was
unremarkable
aside
from
the
photophobia
.

On
postoperative
day
number
two
,
an
Oncology
consult
with
Dr.
Natalie
Mcalister
was
obtained
and

follow-up
appointments
were
scheduled
with
him
as
an
outpatient
.

Following
that
,
the
patient
was
slowly
advanced
to
clear
liquids
and
to
a
regular
diet
once
her
bowels
began
working
when
she
began
having
flatus
.

Her
bowel
function
was
slow
to
develop
and
she
needed
to
remain
n.p.o.
until
postoperative
day
number
six
.

The
patient
was
also
given
supplemental
tube
feedings
to
supplement
her
calories
and
caloric
intake
.

On
postoperative
day
number
seven
,
the
patient
was
tolerating
her
clear
liquid
diet
and
her
tube
feeds
.

She
was
started
on
p.o.
medicines
and
her
first
Belmont-Gardner
drain
was
pulled
due
to
scant
output
.

By
2014-08-09
,
the
patient
was
tolerating
a
full
solid
diet
as
well
as
her
tube
feeds
.

Between
the
two
of
those
,
her
caloric
intake
was
sufficient
for
her
to
sustain
herself
.

She
was
discharged
to
home
with
services
including
tube
feedings
for
her
home
care
.

Therefore
,
she
was
discharged
on
2014-08-09
in
good
condition
.

HISTORY
AND
REASON
FOR
ADMISSION
:

Mr.
Mass
was
a
56
year
old
white
male
who
was
transferred
from
Vassdiysey
Medical
Center
for
rule
out
pancreatic
pseudocyst
.

Mr.
Mass
had
a
past
medical
history
which
included
Wegener
&apos;s
granulomatosis
,
history
of
an
anterior
myocardial
infarction
,
and
gallstone
pancreatitis
.

He
was
admitted
to
Vassdiysey
Medical
Center
with
severe
recurrent
pancreatitis
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
and
abdominal
pain
.

His
amylase
on
admission
there
was
1,961
.

The
patient
had
two
recent
admissions
for
pancreatitis
in
January
1994
,
and
August
1994
.

On
his
current
admission
,
the
patient
was
admitted
to
Free
Medical
Center
.

His
amylase
decreased
to
51
,
and
the
increased
back
to
151
on
hospital
day
#10
.

At
that
time
,
he
spiked
a
temperature
to
103
.

He
also
became
increasingly
confused
.

A
computerized
tomography
scan
done
on
4/16/95
showed
a
large
&quot;
pseudocyst
&quot;
.

He
was
transferred
to
Ph
University
Of
Medical
Center
for
further
surgical
evaluation
.&apos;

in
1993
.

Recent
echocardiogram
suggests
ejection
fraction
of
15%
.

3.
Wegener
&apos;s

scan
:

Pancreatitis
,

.

A
perisplenic
effusion
was
noted
which
appeared
to
communicate
with
the
lesser
sac
collection
.

Gallbladder
was
visualized
with
stones
.

IN
SUMMARY
,
the
patient
was
considered
to
have
severe
necrotizing
pancreatitis
,
with
severe
cardiac
disease
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
,
placed
on
intravenous
fluids
.

He
was
continued
on
his
imipenem
,
intravenously
.

The
patient
was
started
on
total
parenteral
nutrition
.

On
4/17/95
,
GI
Interventional
Radiology
performed
drainage
of
the
peripancreatic
fluid
collection
.

Approximately
one
liter
of
brownish
fluid
was
obtained
and
sent
for
culture
.

The
drainage
catheter
was
left
in
a
pseudocyst
.

The
patient
was
evaluated
by
Cardiology
.

A
Persantine
Thallium
study
demonstrated
a
large
infarct
,
involving
the
posteroseptal
,
anteroseptal
areas
.

Left
ventricular
aneurysm
was
also
noted
;
however
,
no
ischemia
was
seen
.

An
echocardiogram
was
done
.

The
echocardiogram
showed
terrible
left
ventricular
function
,
with
left
ventricular
aneurysm
.

The
right
ventricle
appeared
to
be
acceptable
.

The
percutaneous
drainage
catheter
continued
to
have
high
output
.

The
fluid
was
sent
for
amylase
,
which
came
back
53,230
.

On
4/28/95
,
the
patient
had
new
onset
of
abdominal
pain
.

His
white
count
had
bumped
from
8.3
on
admission
to
18.5
,
on
4/27
.

A
computerized
tomography
scan
of
the
abdomen
was
performed
.

Approximately
100
cc.&apos;s
of
thick
brownish
material
was
aspirated
through
the
indwelling
catheter
.

The
computerized
tomography
scan
showed
the
catheter
tip
in
good
position
.

Because
of
the
patient
&apos;s
deteriorating
state
,
the
patient
was
brought
to
the
operating
room
on
4/28/95
.

An
exploratory
laparotomy
was
performed
.

The
splenic
flexure
had
a
purulent
exudative
process
along
the
antimesenteric
surface
.

Thus
,
the
splenic
flexure
and
a
portion
of
the
descending
colon
were
resected
.

The
patient
underwent
a
left
colectomy
with
end
transverse
colostomy
,
and
oversewing
of
the
descending
colon
.

Drainage
of
the
pancreatic
necrosis
was
also
done
.

The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
fairly
well
,
and
was
transferred
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

In
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
,
the
patient
had
a
prolonged
course
.

The
patient
was
then
extubated
on
postoperative
day
#2
,
but
remained
pressor-dependent
.

He
remained
on
imipenem
,
and
Vancomycin
was
also
started
.

Thereafter
,
the
patient
had
a
long
and
complicated
postoperative
course
.

He
was
eventually
transferred
to
the
floor
,
where
he
remained
meta-stable
.

He
had
repeated
episodes
of
hypotension
to
80-90
systolic/40-50
diastolic
.

These
resolved
without
incident
.

He
also
had
repeated
temperature
spikes
.

After
repeated
work
ups
,
it
was
felt
that
these
were
probably
due
to
remaining
infection
in
the
peripancreatic
area
.

His
drainage
tube
from
the
peripancreatic
area
was
gradually
advanced
,
and
eventually
discontinued
.

Mr.
Mass
was
placed
on
multiple
courses
of
antibiotics
.

Most
recently
,
he
was
on
a
28
day
course
of
Vancomycin
,
ofloxacin
,
and
Flagyl
,
for
blood
cultures
that
were
positive
for
gram
positive
cocci
and
enteric
and
non-enteric
gram
negative
rods
.

This
28
day
course
was
completed
on
07/15/95
.

The
patient
was
also
treated
initially
with
amphotericin-B
and
then
with
fluconazole
for
a
computerized
tomography
guided
aspirate
of
a
small
fluid
collection
around
his
pancreas
,
which
grew
Candida
albicans
.

The
patient
also
had
several
episodes
of
fungal
cystitis
with
Torulopsis
glabrata
,
going
from
his
urine
.

He
was
treated
with
amphotericin-B
bladder
washes
for
this
.

Mr.
Mass
was
initially
anticoagulated
for
his
left
ventricular
aneurysm
.

He
remained
stable
from
a
cardiac
fashion
.

He
did
have
problems
with
po
intake
.

He
had
repeated
bouts
of
small-volume
emesis
that
may
have
been
secondary
to
reflux
.

He
was
treated
with
a
variety
of
anti-emetics
,
most
recently
Granisetron
,
with
only
mild
success
.

He
remained
total
parenteral
nutrition-dependent
throughout
his
hospital
course
.

By
the
end
of
June
,
it
became
clear
that
Mr.
Mass
would
require
aggressive
surgical
intervention
in
order
to
eradicate
his
intra-abdominal
bursts
of
intermittent
sepsis
;
however
,
long
discussions
with
the
patient
and
his
wife
,
who
was
his
health-care
proxy
,
revealed
that
they
felt
that
no
further
aggressive
intervention
be
attempted
.

The
patient
had
been
made
a
do
not
resuscitate
do
not
intubate
patient
earlier
in
his
hospital
stay
.

Multiple
discussions
were
held
between
Dr.
Mass
,
the
rest
of
the
surgical
team
,
and
the
patient
&apos;s
wife
,
with
this
same
result
.

After
discussion
with
the
patient
&apos;s
primary
doctor
,
Dr.
Douet
at
Vassdiysey
Medical
Center
,
it
was
felt
that
the
patient
and
his
family
would
be
best
served
if
the
patient
were
transferred
to
Vassdiysey
Medical
Center
.

Of
note
,
given
the
patient
&apos;s
do
not
resuscitate
status
and
the
risk
for
bleeding
,
the
patient
&apos;s
Coumadin
was
stopped
without
incident
several
weeks
before
transfer
.

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

Pt
is
a
78
yo
male
with
atrial
fibrillation
,
s/p
multiple
CVA
s,
CHF
,
HTN
,
DM2
transferred
from
the
CMED
CCU
s/p
intervention
for
cholangitis
.

1)
Acute
cholangitis
:
Pt
was
admitted
to
the
ICU
,
intubated
,
and
ERCP
performed
,
likely
stone
obstructing
CBD
.

Stent
was
placed
and
patient
was
treated
with
antibiotics
(
Zosyn
-
>
Ciprofloxacin
).

Per
ERCP
fellow
,
plan
is
for
patient
to
return
in
four
weeks
to
see
Dr.
Suzanne
Davis
,
at
which
time
he
will
likely
have
repeat
cholangiogram
and
removal
of
stent
and
stone
.

If
this
is
still
problematic
,
pt
may
also
need
a
sphincterotomy
.

Dr.Demby
secretary
will
contact
patient
at
home
the
week
after
discharge
to
schedule
this
for
the
end
of
January
.

Pt
is
to
continue
ciprofloxacin
for
a
complete
14
day
course
.

2)
Mechanical
mitral
valve
:
Anticoagulation
was
reversed
for
ERCP
.

After
this
he
was
anticoagulated
with
heparin
drip
.

INR
was
1.9
on
discharge
.

He
was
given
sc
lovenox
x
1
and
will
continue
this
the
day
after
discharge
bid
for
one
day
.

VNA
will
check
his
INR
at
home
and
page
his
PCP
with
the
results
.

3)
Atrial
fibrillation
:
Rate
controlled
and
on
warfarin
.

While
in
the
hospital
he
had
several
episodes
of
pauses
,
none
longer
than
2.5
seconds
.

His
digoxin
was
held
and
his
metoprolol
was
titrated
down
from
his
home
dose
.

Once
the
digoxin
was
no
longer
having
effect
,
metoprolol
was
titrated
back
to
home
dose
.

4)
CHF
:
Pt
was
oxygen
dependent
for
most
of
the
hospital
course
,
CXR
was
consistent
with
pulmonary
edema
.

He
was
diuresed
with
lasix
with
good
effect
.

Volume
overload
likely
ocurred
in
the
setting
of
IV
fluids
given
in
the
ICU
.

Did
not
require
lasix
on
discharge
.

5)
E.
coli
bacteremia
/
sepsis
:
Source
of
acute
cholangitis
as
above
.

Pt
required
3
day
stay
in
the
surgical
ICU
and
intubation
as
above
.

6)
Intubation
:
Pt
was
97%
on
room
air
on
arrival
to
Cindy
,
developed
rapid
ventricular
reponse
to
a
fib
which
was
treated
,
but
after
that
period
of
time
required
oxygen
,
presumably
for
pulmonary
edema
.

In
the
Lori
pt
was
given
3L
NS
as
well
as
1
unit
of
FFP
,
and
oxygen
requirements
contimued
to
climb
.

In
the
CMED
CCU
pt
was
intubated
for
ERCP
procedure
.

He
was
extubated
the
next
morning
.

preoperatively
for
surgery
on
7/4/98
.

The
patient
&apos;s
workup
up
until
that
time

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
54
year-old
female
with
a
history
of
breast
cancer
with
known
brain
mets
,
history
of
PE
,
recent
radiation
therapy
and
steroids
who
presented
in
2012-04-23
with
myopathy
presumed
secondary
to
sterids
,
which
have
been
given
for
her
brain
mets
.

She
was
later
sent
to
rehab
,
but
returned
early
in
April
with
increased
cough
with
exertion
with
fever
to
101
.

She
was
treated
with
Levaquin
given
her
temperatures
and
differential
diagnosis
of
increased
PE
burden
load
,
infections
or
pneumonia
and
questionable
lymphangitic
spread
of
her
cancer
.

The
patient
did
not
experience
improvement
in
her
symptoms
and
was
readmitted
on
06-11
with
continued
dyspnea
and
fevers
.

Review
of
CTA
showed
no
PE
,
but
there
was
ground
glass
opacities
on
CT
,
so
PCP
was
considered
highly
unlikely
given
her
recent
history
of
steroid
use
.

Her
induced
sputum
was
negative
and
BOL
was
done
and
also
negative
.

Sputum
cultures
were
negative
.

She
was
given
Bactrim
and
she
had
improvement
in
the
shortness
of
breath
after
her
Bactrim
was
started
and
improved
room
air
sats
and
was
sent
home
on
Bactrim
.

She
then
continued
to
do
poorly
and
then
returned
on
06-19
.

She
presented
on
clinic
on
06-20
with
hypotension
for
which
she
was
given
intravenous
fluids
.

She
spiked
a
fever
to
103
with
blood
pressures
hypertensive
into
the
systolic
80
s
and
with
rigors
.

Chest
x-ray
showed
a
question
of
left
lung
opacity
.

The
patient
was
given
Vancomycin
and
a
gram
of
intravenous
fluids
.

Today
,
the
patient
was
found
in
the
bathroom
and
became
hypoxic
with
saturations
in
the
80
s
and
was
responsive
to
oxygen
,
but
was
still
tachypneic
without
improvement
and
was
placed
on
nonrebreather
.

Currently
the
patient
is
admitted
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
further
medical
care
.

Currently
the
patient
is
short
of
breath
without
chest
pain
or
dysphagia
.

She
had
a
CT
from
the

of
her
abdomen
and
pelvis
showing
marked
increased
consolidations
at
the
left
lung
base
and
question
of
new
left
sided
pleural
effusion
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1.
Pulmonary
:

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
respiratory
distress
and
febrile
hypotension
with
a
question
of
a
new
infiltrate
on
her
chest
x-ray
.

The
exact
etiology
of
the
patient
's
respiratory
distress
was
presumed
to
be
questionable
multifactorial
.

There
was
concern
about
possible
pneumonia
.

Also
she
had
a
history
of
PE
and
also
there
was
concern
about
possible
lymphangitic
spread
of
her
breast
CA
.

Given
her
fevers
and
shortness
of
breath
the
patient
was
treated
with
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
initially
started
on
Ceptaz
,
Levaquin
and
__________
and
Clindamycin
.

Lab
two
antibiotics
were
added
considering
the
patient
was
thought
to
be
a
relatively
high
risk
for
PCP
Douglas
.

The
patient
was
initially
trialed
on
BiPAP
,
but
the
patient
was
increasingly
dyspneic
,
increased
respiratory
stress
and
ultimately
needed
to
be
intubated
on
06-22
.

Earlier
during
her
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
she
underwent
bronchoscopy
,
which
was
sent
for
cytology
and
multiple
bacterial
pathogens
all
of
which
were
negative
.

Ultimately
her
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
continued
and
she
began
to
defervesce
and
her
bacterial
studies
particulaly
from
BAL
lavage
were
found
to
be
negative
.

The
patient
had
multiple
antibiotics
withdrawn
.

Clindamycin
and
_______________
was
discontinued
early
in
hospital
course
.

Her
PCP
was
thought
to
be
negative
.

In
addition
,
Vancomycin
,
Levaquin
were
also
discontinued
.

She
was
later
continued
on
Ceftazidine
and
Clindamycin
for
possible
gram
negative
infection
and
also
for
possible
post
obstructive
picture
that
she
would
be
at
risk
for
given
her
pulmonary
anatomy
.

As
the
Hubbard
Regional
Hospital
hospital
course
went
on
the
patient
's
respiratory
did
not
show
mild
improvement
on
the
ventilator
.

She
was
able
to
oxygenate
originally
.

Unfortunately
her
mental
status
failed
to
improve
despite
having
been
off
all
sedative
medications
for
several
days
.

Later
in
her
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
family
meetings
took
place
and
given
the
patient
's
overall
poor
prognosis
with
decreased
mental
status
it
was
decided
that
the
patient
would
become
CMO
.

Subsequently
she
was
extubated
on
06-28
.

The
patient
continues
to
actually
ventilate
well
off
of
the
respiratory
.

However
,
she
is
CMO
and
will
not
be
intubated
for
respiratory
distress
.

2.
Cardiovascular
:

The
patient
was
initially
transferred
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
thought
to
be
exhibiting
septic
physiology
,
respiratory
distress
and
hypotensive
.

She
required
aggressive
intravenous
fluids
and
later
required
pressor
support
with
neo-synephrine
.

Later
during
her
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
she
was
felt
to
be
somewhat
overloaded
and
intravenous
fluids
were
cut
back
.

It
was
quite
difficult
weaning
her
off
of
neo-synephrine
.

She
was
also
given
stress
dose
steroids
.

Later
in
her
hospital
course
she
also
had
an
echocardiogram
for
question
of
new
ECG
findings
in
her
inferior
leads
.

Her
echocardiogram
,
however
,
was
essentially
normal
with
an
ejection
fraction
of
55%
without
any
gross
wall
motion
abnormalities
or
valvular
pathology
.

As
mentioned
above
the
patient
's
hemodynamic
status
was
tenuous
throughout
her
hospital
course
as
it
was
difficult
to
wean
the
patient
off
of
neo-synephrine
.

By
06-28
,
however
,
the
patient
had
been
off
of
neo-synephrine
,
but
at
this
time
as
mentioned
above
the
patient
was
deemed
to
be
CMO
per
discussion
with
physicians
and
her
husband
/
health
care
proxy
.

3.
Hematology
:

Patient
with
a
history
of
known
malignancy
and
also
a
history
of
pulmonary
embolisms
from
2012-04-23
.

Earlier
in
her
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
the
team
was
concerned
about
possible
pulmonary
embolisms
as
a
possible
source
of
the
patient
's
respiratory
decompensation
.

However
,
the
patient
also
had
brain
metastasis
and
at
this
point
anticoagulation
was
thought
to
be
a
contraindication
given
risk
for
hemorrhage
into
these
tumors
.

She
did
have
lower
extremity
doppler
ultrasounds
,
which
were
negative
.

4.
Infectious
disease
:

As
mentioned
above
patient
initially
hypotension
,
febrile
and
in
respiratory
distress
presumed
to
be
septic
source
likely
pulmonary
.

Initially
the
patient
was
treated
with
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
including
Vancomycin
,
Ceptaz
,
Levaquin
,
Clindamycin
and
_________.

All
of
her
cultures
are
negative
to
date
.

She
was
negative
for
PCP
and
subsequently
_____________
was
continued
and
Clindamycin
was
changed
for
anaerobic
coverage
.

In
addition
her
Vancomycin
and
Levaquin
were
also
discontinued
.

The
patient
remained
afebrile
during
the
majority
of
her
hospital
course
.

By
virtue
of
discussions
on
06-28
the
patient
was
deemed
to
be
CMO
and
all
antibiotics
were
withdrawn
at
this
point
.

5.
Gastroenterology
:

The
patient
had
an
abdominal
CT
earlier
in
her
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
,
which
was
essentially
negative
for
an
intraabdominal
pathology
.

She
was
initially
supported
with
tube
feeds
during
her
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
,
but
at
this
point
the
patient
is
CMO
and
tube
feeds
have
been
subsequently
discontinued
.

DISPOSITION
:

The
patient
's
attending
physician
was
in
constant
communication
with
the
patient
's
health
care
proxy
her
husband
.

As
her
Intensive
Care
Unit
course
continued
and
the
patient
showed
minimal
signs
of
meaningful
improvement
,
continued
discussions
were
had
with
the
family
about
possibly
changing
code
status
.

Ultimately
it
was
decided
by
06-28
that
the
patient
had
shown
minimal
improvement
and
minimal
evidence
of
improvement
status
,
it
was
decided
at
this
point
for
the
patient
to
be
extubated
and
to
move
toward
CMO
care
.

Subsequently
all
antibiotics
,
blood
draws
and
supportive
blood
pressure
medications
were
withdrawn
.

Currently
she
is
comfortable
with
morphine
and
Ativan
prn.

Currently
plans
are
in
the
making
for
arranging
for
the
patient
to
have
home
hospice
care
.

Please
see
discharge
addendum
for
further
developments
in
the
patient
's
care

.

The
patient
was
referred
to
CT
surgery
who
was
seen
and
accepted
for
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
.

On
09-06
,
he
was
brought
to
the
Operating
Room
,
please
see
the
Operating
Room
report
for
full
details
.

In
summary
,
he
had
a
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
times
4
with
a
LIMA
to
the
LAD
,
saphenous
vein
graft
OM1
,
saphenous
vein
graft
OM2
and
saphenous
vein
graft
of
the
diagonal
.

His
bypass
time
was
105
minutes
with
a
cross
clamp
time
of
87
minutes
.

He
tolerated
the
operation
well
and
was
transferred
from
the
Operating
Room
to
the
cardiothoracic
ICU
.

At
the
time
of
transfer
,
he
was
AV
paced
at
a
rate
of
88
beats
per
minute
.

He
had
Propofol
at
30
mc
per
kg
per
minute
and
Neo-Synephrine
to
maintain
his
blood
pressure
.

The
patient
did
well
in
the
immediate
postoperative
period
.

His
anesthesia
was
reversed
.

He
was
weaned
from
the
ventilator
and
successfully
extubated
.

He
remained
hemodynamically
stable
throughout
the
remainder
of
his
operative
day
.

On
postoperative
day
1
,
the
patient
remained
hemodynamically
stable
on
a
Neo-Synephrine
drip
to
maintain
an
adequate
blood

pressure
.

He
remained
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
as
he
was
unable
to
be
weaned
off
of
his
Neo-Synephrine
drip
.

On
postoperative
day
1
,
his
Swan-Ganz
catheter
was
removed
as
well
.

On
postoperative
day
2
,
another
attempt
was
made
to
wean
the
patient
off
of
Neo-Synephrine
unsuccessfully
.

His
chest
tubes
were
removed
.

However
,
because
he
could
not
be
weaned
from
the
Neo-Synephrine
,
he
again
remained
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

On
postoperative
day
3
,
an
additional
attempt
was
made
to
wean
the
patient
from
his
Neo-Synephrine
unsuccessfully
.

The
patient
also
received
a
unit
of
packed
red
blood
cells
in
an
additional
attempt
to
wean
from
Neo-Synephrine
.

This
also
did
not
help
in
the
attempt
to
wean
from
Neo-Synephrine
.

His
Foley
catheter
was
removed
and
he
remained
again
in
the
ICU
.

On
postoperative
day
4
,
additional
attempts
were
made
to
wean
the
patient
off
of
his
Neo-Synephrine
,
however
,
he
continued
to
drop
his
blood
pressure
whenever
an
attempt
was
made
.

Other
than
that
,
the
patient
remained
completely
stable
.

On
postoperative
day
5
,
the
patient
was
finally
weaned
off
of
his
Neo-Synephrine
and
diuresis
was
begun
.

He
remained
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
an
additional
day
to
monitor
his
hemodynamics
.

On
postoperative
day
6
,
the
patient
remained
hemodynamically
stable
and
he
was
transferred
to
the
floor
for
continuing
postoperative
care
and
cardiac
rehabilitation
.

Over
the
next
two
days
,
the
patient
had
an
uneventful
hospitalization
.

His
activity
level
was
increased
with
the
assistance
of
physical
therapy
department
and
the
nursing
staff
.

On
postoperative
day
7
,
it
was
decided
that

outside
hospital
with
a
low
hematocrit
of
21
and
with
guaiac-positive
stool
.

The
day
prior
to
admission
,
he
experienced
dyspnea
on
exertion
,
and
on
the
day
of
admission
he
collapsed
and
complained
of
substantial
weakness
.

He
denied
any
melana
,
any
hematemesis
,
nausea
or
vomiting
.

He
was
taken
to
an
outside
hospital
at
the
time
at
which
time
it
was
found
that
his
hematocrit
was
21
,
blood
pressure
90/60
,
and
his
INR
was
3.3
.

Of
note
,
he
is
anti-coagulated
for
an
artificial
heart
valve
.

He
was
at
that
point
given
1
unit
of
packed
red
blood
cells
.

On
further
questioning
,
the
patient
reported
that
he
started
to
feel
&quot;
different
&quot;
several
days
ago
with
slowing
and
difficult
ambulation
progressing
to
complete
inability
to
ambulate
.

He
was
also
short
of
breath
with
ambulation
,
but
he
does
have
baseline
shortness
of
breath
with
exertion
.

He
denied
any
chest
pain
,
dysuria
,
loss
of
consciousness
,
fevers
,
chills
or
any
history
of
myocardial
infarction
.

Patient
was
last
admitted
to
Padrugmoff
Hospital
with
a
hematocrit
of
24.5
,
and
was
asymptomatic
prior
to
admission
.

At
that
time
,
he
had
guaiac-positive
and
had
a
small
bowel
follow
through
which
was
negative
.

He
was
transfused
4
units
during
that
admission
and
discharged
with
a
hematocrit
of
34
on
vitamin
C
and
iron
sulfate
.

of
78
,
1.7
;
for
a
sodium
,
potassium
139
and

.

OTHER
NOTALBE
LABS
:

Patient
was
found
to
have
a
troponin
of
0.71
on
admission
with
a
CK
of
46
and
CKMB
of
3.4
.

ASSESSMENT
:

At
that
time
,
it
was
felt
that
the
patient
was
likely
having
a
repeat
GI
bleed
and
while
he
was
hemodynamically
stable
,
he
had
evidently
lost
a
substantial
amount
of
blood
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1.
GI
:

Patient
was
transfused
2
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
overnight
,
the
first
night
after
admission
and
his
hematocrit
bumped
up
appropriately
.

He
remained
hemodynamically
stable
throughout
his
admission
.

He
was
continued
on
a
proton
pump
inhibitor
and
on
iron
sulfate
and
vitamin
C
.

His
Coumadin
was
held
at
the
time
given
the
bleeding
,
even
though
it
was
important
to
keep
his
INR
2.5-3.5
,
given
his
artificial
valve
it
was
felt
that
the
risk
of
continued
bleeding
was
to
great
to
continue
the
Coumadin
.

He
was
subsequently
seen
by
the
GI
team
who
performed
an
upper
endoscopy
which
demonstrated
the
following
:

In
the
esophagus
,
there
was
a
small
hiatal
hernia
and
in
the
stomach
there
is
evidence
of
erosive
gastritis
of
the
body
of
the
stomach
and
the
antrum
,
the
mucous
appeared
edematous
.

A
small
polyp
was
found
in
the
fundus
which
stigmata
of
old
bleeding
;
an
Endoclip
was
applied
to
this
.

Another
polyp
was
found
in
the
antrum
and
cold
biopsies
were
obtained
there
.

In
the
duodenum
,
a
small
AVM
was
noted
in
the
second
portion
of
the
duodenum
and
was
cauterized
.

The
biopsy
subsequently
demonstrated
a
hyperplastic
polyp
with
acute
and
chronic
inflammation
and
erosion
and
reactive
epithelial
changes
but
no
dysplasia
.

Also
of
note
,
prior
to
the
upper
endoscopy
,
the
patient
received
fresh
frozen
plasma
to
reverse
his
anticoagulation
.

Patient
remained
hemodynamically
stable
during
and
after
the
upper
endoscopy
and
his
hematocrit
remained
above
30
following
this
until
the
point
of
discharge
.

His
last
recorded
hematocrit
on
discharge
was
31.3
.

His
last
BUN
and
creatinine
were
42
and
1.5
with
an
INR
of
2.5
.

Consideration
was
given
to
performing
a
repeat
colonoscopy
.

This
was
discussed
with
the
GI
Service
who
felt
that
this
was
not
necessary
given
the
recent
colonoscopy
that
he
had
had
in
05/2003
.

2.
Cardiovascular
:

A
:

Ischemia
:

Patient
&apos;s
troponin
bump
was
found
to
be
likely
to
demand
ischemia
in
the
setting
of
his
GI
bleed
,
it
was
not
felt
that
he
was
having
acute
coronary
syndrome
.

On
discharge
,
he
was
continued
on
his
aspirin
,
simvastatin
and
his
Lopressor
which
was
initially
held
,
and
subsequently
restarted
.

B
:

Rhythm
:

Patient
continued
to
be
in
A-fib.
throughout
the
admission
and
was
restarted
on
his
Coumadin
concurrently
with
heparin
.

Heparin
was
subsequently
DCd
once
his
INR
reached
a
therapeutic
level
between
2.5-3.5
.

His
last
reported
INR
on
discharge
was
2.5
.

C
:

Valves
:

Patient
had
,
as
noted
above
,
his
anticoagulation
was
initially
reversed
despite
his
having
artificial
valves
.

However
,
his
Coumadin
was
subsequently
restarted
and
he
achieved
therapeutic
INR
levels
before
discharge
.

D
:

Pump
:

Patient
,
during
this
hospital
course
,
became
hypervolemic
likely
due
to
his
diuretics
being
held
and
due
to
his
receiving
blood
products
.

He
was
diuresed
initially
with
one
dose
of
Lasix
and
subsequently
with
one
dose
of
torsemide
after
it
was
discovered
that
he
developed
thrombocytopenia
on
a
prior
admission
in
reaction
to
Lasix
.

He
subsequently
was
diuresed
to
a
euvolemic
state
.

Of
note
,
he
did
not
become
thrombocytopenic
on
this
admission
.

DISPOSITION
:

Was
discharged
on
11/16/2003
in
stable
condition
with
the
last
recorded
hematocrit
of
31.3
.

He
was
asked
to
continue
on
his
Nexium
,
iron
and
vitamin
C
and
was
continued
on
his
other
home
medications
.

DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS
:

His
final
medications
on
discharge
were
as
follows
:

Aspirin
325
,
he
was
restarted
on
a
PPI
,
also
on
iron
,
vitamin
C
,
Lopressor
12.5
b.i.d
.

Of
note
,
this
was
at
a
decreased
dose
compared
to
that
which
he
came
in
on
,
Coumadin
7.5
,
mg
,
torsemide
100
q.d.
,
sucralfate
,
simvastatin
,
Diovan
.

CONDITION
ON
DISCHARGE
:

He
was
discharged
in
stable
condition
with
instructions
to
follow
up
with
his
PCP
as
well
as
to
follow
up
with
the
Anticoagulation

CHIEF
COMPLAINT
:

Cardiac
arrest
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
49
year
old
man
who
was
admitted
to
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
status
post
cardiac
arrest
.

History
was
obtained
per
the
Emergency
Department
report
as
well
as
from
the
patient
's
family
.

Information
was
very
limited
regarding
the
circumstances
of
his
cardiac
arrest
.

Reportedly
,
the
patient
was
at
a
local
restaurant
where
he
was
noted
to
be
unresponsive
.

EMS
was
called
and
reported
to
arrive
on
scene
within
three
minutes
.

The
patient
was
asystolic
but
regained
a
perfusing
rhythm
after
2
mg
of
Epinephrine
and
2
mg
of
Atropine
.

He
was
intubated
in
the
field
and
brought
to
the
Emergency
Department
.

He
remained
unresponsive
despite
the
administration
of
Narcan
.

CT
examinations
of
the
head
,
chest
,
abdomen
and
pelvis
were
all
unremarkable
.

Initial
chest
x-ray
showed
a
left
retrocardiac
opacity
and
prominent
interstitium
though
his
lung
volumes
were
low
.

Subsequent
chest
x-ray
showed
right
main
stem
intubation
with
left
lung
collapse
which
had
corrected
with
withdrawal
of
the
endotracheal
tube
.

The
patient
was
then
transferred
to
the
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
induced
hypothermia
given
his
hemodynamic
stability
,
ongoing
unresponsiveness
and
recent
out
of
hospital
cardiac
arrest

.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Cardiac
arrest
-
His
arrest
was
of
unknown
etiology
at
the
time
of
admission
.

No
further
history
was
ever
gained
about
his
cardiac
arrest
throughout
his
hospitalization
.

CT
angiogram
had
been
negative
for
pulmonary
embolism
.

The
patient
had
an
echocardiogram
on
2013-04-26
,
which
showed
a
normal
ejection
fraction
and
trivial
mitral
regurgitation
;
otherwise
no
obvious
abnormalities
were
seen
.

Given
the
patient
had
an
out
of
hospital
arrest
,
remained
unresponsive
despite
hemodynamic
stability
,
he
was
treated
with
induced
hypothermia
and
with
cold
packs
and
a
cooling
blanket
were
placed
with
goals
of
reducing
his
core
body
temperature
to
32
degrees
Celsius
for
a
period
of
twelve
hours
at
which
point
he
would
be
rewarmed
over
the
subsequent
six
hours
.

This
was
done
,
however
,
as
in
problem
number
two
below
,
we
were
not
successful
in
any
neurologic
recovery
.

Neurology
-
The
patient
remained
unresponsive
after
the
induced
hypothermia
,
the
patient
was
noticed
to
develop
myoclonic
jerks
and
occasional
fluttering
of
his
eyelids
.

Electroencephalogram
revealed
the
patient
was
experiencing
persistent
seizure
activity
.

Neurology
was
consulted
and
the
patient
was
treated
very
aggressively
,
loaded
with
multiple
drugs
,
including
Ativan
and
Propofol
drips
.

The
patient
continued
to
demonstrate
seizure
activity
despite
this
.

He
was
loaded
with
Dilantin
and
ultimately
was
treated
with
a
Pentobarb
coma
.

After
multiple
attempts
of
weaning
the
Pentobarb
,
the
patient
was
continually
reverting
to
status
epilepticus
which
was
never
able
to
be
suppressed
.

Infectious
disease
-
Over
the
course
of
his
hospital
stay
,
the
patient
's
white
blood
cell
count
rose
to
a
peak
of
17
.

Multiple
cultures
were
done
and
the
patient
was
ultimately
found
to
have
methicillin
resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
bacteremia
,
pneumonia
,
and
urinary
tract
infection
.

For
all
these
infections
,
the
patient
was
treated
with
Vancomycin
and
he
was
also
on
Levofloxacin
and
Flagyl
for
presumed
aspiration
pneumonia
at
the
time
of
his
admission
.

Blood
cultures
cleared
by
2013-05-03
.

Sputum
culture
as
late
as
2013-05-10
,
however
was
still
positive
for
coagulase
positive
Staphylococcus
which
was
methicillin
resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
.

The
patient
remained
gravely
ill
throughout
his
hospital
stay
and
had
multiple
meetings
were
held
with
his
family
with
his
son
being
his
next
of
kin
.

Ultimately
it
was
decided
that
the
patient
's
wishes
would
be
to
not
be
maintained
in
a
vegetative
state
and
given
his
poor
prognosis
ultimately
the
decision
was
made
to
pursue
comfort
measures
only
.

With
these
goals
of
care
,
the
patient
expired
on
2013-05-11
.

The
family
did
consent
to
a
postmortem
examination

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
63
year-old
woman
transferred
from
Pre
Health
on
June
19
,
1998
to
the
Verg
Medical
Center
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
evaluation
of
thrombotic
thrombocytopenic
purpura
and
bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia
.

On
May
12
,
1998
,
the
patient
presented
to
Pre
Health
with
fever
,
cough
,
dyspnea
and
a
chest
x-ray
revealing
a
patchy
infiltrate
in
the
right
lung
.

She
was
treated
with
Clindamycin
and
Erythromycin
which
were
changed
to
Trovan
and
then
transferred
to
A
Hospital
.

On
May
27
,
1998
,
the
patient
desaturated
to
40%
with
a
temperature
of
100.5
degrees
.

Her
oxygen
saturations
improved
to
only
92%
on
100%
face
mask
and
she
was
admitted
to
Pre
Health
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

Chest
x-ray
there
revealed
bilateral
pulmonary
infiltrates
with
increasing
pleural
effusion
.

A
VQ
scan
was
high
probability
,
but
no
pulmonary
angiogram
was
done
and
an
echocardiogram
revealed
a
normal
left
ventricle
with
no
wall
motion
abnormality
and
an
ejection
fraction
of
75%
.

On
May
24
,
1998
,
the
patient
had
a
CT
scan
of
the
chest
which
revealed
diffuse
alveolar
infiltrates
at
the
right
base
,
mediastinal
lymphadenopathy
and
bilateral
pleural
effusions
.

At
this
point
,
a
diagnosis
of
lupus
was
considered
and
her
ANA
was
1:640
and
her
rheumatoid
factor
and
ANCA
were
negative
.

She
was
started
on
a
steroid
trial
at
that
point
.

Her
pleural
fluid
was
tapped
and
it
was
negative
for
malignancy
.

On
June
11
,
1998
,
the
patient
had
a
video
assisted
thoracoscopic
study
of
the
right
lung
which
revealed
chronic
interstitial
pneumonitis
with
a
bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia-like
reaction
and
a
chest
tube
was
placed
.

The
patient
was
then
started
on
40
mg
of
Prednisone
q.
day
.

From
May
27
,
1998
through
June
19
,
1998
,
the
patient
had
a
decline
in
her
platelets
from
394
to
28
with
a
stable
hematocrit
of
32
to
33
and
a
rise
in
creatinine
from
1.0
to
3.8
.

On
June
19
,
1998
,
she
was
transferred
to
the
Verg
Medical
Center
Medical
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
evaluation
of
possible
thrombotic
thrombocytopenic
purpura
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1
)
Bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia
:

The
video
assisted
thoracoscopic
study
at
the
outside
hospital
was
consistent
with
bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia
.

The
patient
was
continued
on
steroids
throughout
the
course
of
her
stay
.

This
was
changed
to
Solu-Medrol
part
way
through
the
course
due
to
her
hematologic
problems
,
see
below
.

By
discharge
,
she
was
returned
to
40
mg
of
Prednisone
q.
day
times
one
month
to
be
followed
by
a
slow
taper
.

The
patient
&apos;s
bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia
appeared
to
improve
slowly
throughout
her
hospital
course
,
however
on
July
12
,
1998
,
after
starting
dialysis
(
see
below
)
,
the
patient
desaturated
and
required
supplemental
oxygen
.

Repeat
chest
x-rays
and
chest
CT
scans
appeared
consistent
with
pulmonary
edema
from
volume
overload
given
her
renal
failure
and
eventually
,
the
patient
&apos;s
pulmonary
status
did
improve
after
significant
volume
removal
with
dialysis
for
several
weeks
.

At
the
time
of
her
discharge
,
the
patient
was
still
requiring
two
liters
of
supplemental
oxygen
to
maintain
her
oxygen
saturations
in
the
mid
90%
.

2
)
Thrombotic
thrombocytopenic
purpura
:

The
patient
was
initially
admitted
with
platelet
count
of
28
,
hematocrit
of
32
,
LDH
of
496
with
2+
schistocytes
and
2+
spherocytes
on
her
smear
.

This
was
felt
to
be
consistent
with
thrombotic
thrombocytopenic
purpura
and
on
June
20
,
1998
,
she
was
started
on
daily
plasma
exchange
which
continued
through
July
27
,
1999
.

She
was
also
changed
to
intravenous
Solu-Medrol
50
mg
q.
day
which
was
changed
back
to
40
mg
of
Prednisone
prior
to
discharge
.

Her
platelet
count
initially
rose
to
a
maximum
of
159
on
July
3
,
1998
,
then
they
steadily
fell
to
a
low
of
60
on
July
20
,
1999
.

Her
LDH
which
peaked
at
1255
decreased
to
the
mid
200s
,
but
remained
elevated
.

She
continued
to
have
a
few
schistocytes
on
her
smear
,
but
it
was
much
decreased
.

The
patient
also
required
red
blood
cell
transfusions
,
approximately
two
units
every
seven
to
ten
days
to
maintain
her
hematocrit
.

Eventually
,
her
plasma
exchange
was
tapered
to
a
smaller
and
smaller
dose
each
day
and
then
discontinued
altogether
after
July
27
,
1999
.

After
this
,
the
patient
&apos;s
platelet
count
rose
to
a
maximum
of
177
on
discharge
.

It
is
felt
that
the
patient
&apos;s
thrombotic
thrombocytopenic
purpura
has
resolved
.

She
will
continue
on
her
Prednisone
for
one
month
as
above
for
the
bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia
with
a
very
slow
taper
.

3
)
Renal
:

The
patient
presented
in
acute
renal
failure
with
a
BUN
of
101
and
a
creatinine
of
3.7
.

Throughout
the
month
of
June
,
she
had
a
rising
Potassium
phosphate
and
increasing
volume
overload
with
decreasing
response
to
diuretics
and
she
was
finally
initiated
on
dialysis
with
ultrafiltration
on
July
12
,
1998
.

The
opinion
of
the
Renal
consult
was
that
this
was
permanent
and
non-reversible
renal
failure
since
it
did
not
improve
with
dialysis
and
the
patient
will
continue
on
dialysis
three
times
per
week
.

She
required
approximately
five
liters
of
ultrafiltration
fluid
removal
at
each
dialysis
session
due
to
her
significant
volume
overload
.

During
the
course
of
her
dialysis
,
she
had
a
great
improvement
in
her
lower
extremity
edema
and
her
oxygen
saturation
.

4
)
Infectious
disease
:

The
patient
had
multiple
line
infections
during
her
admission
including
a
confirmed
coag.
negative
Staphylococcus
line
infection
with
positive
blood
cultures
on
June
23
,
1998
,
July
4
,
1998
,
July
8
,
1998
and
July
9
,
1998
.

The
patient
eventually
had
a
left
subclavian
Tesio
catheter
placed
and
a
right
brachial
PICC
line
placed
on
July
10
,
1998
which
remained
patent
and
uninfected
.

She
received
a
full
three
week
course
of
Vancomycin
and
also
received
a
three
week
course
of
Ceftazidime
.

In
addition
,
she
had
a
fungal
urinary
tract
infection
treated
with
Amphojel
bladder
irrigation
,
which
was
followed
by
a
Klebsiella
urinary
tract
infection
for
which
she
received
Levofloxacin
times
fourteen
days
.

She
also
received
a
fourteen
day
course
of
Acyclovir
which
was
begun
on
June
21
,
1998
for
perianal
lesions
consistent
with
herpes
simplex
virus
.

She
was
also
on
Fluconazole
for
some
oral
thrush
which
was
inadvertently
continued
for
a
total
of
thirty
days
.

The
patient
was
also
started
on
Bactrim
one
double
strength
tablet
q.o.d.
as
prophylaxis
for
Pneumocystis
carinii
pneumonia
while
on
her
high
dose
steroids
.

5
)
Rheumatology
:

The
patient
was
admitted
with
a
question
of
lupus
given
her
ANA
of
1:640
although
her
rheumatoid
factor
and
ANCA
were
negative
.

Unfortunately
throughout
her
admission
,
we
were
unable
to
test
any
more
titers
since
she
was
receiving
daily
plasma
exchange
.

A
repeat
ANA
,
rheumatoid
factor
and
ANCA
may
be
repeated
as
an
outpatient
.

FOLLOW-UP
:

1
)
The
patient
will
follow-up
with
her
primary
care
physician
,
Dr.

Study
,
in
Arvus
after
she
is
discharged
from
rehabilitation
.

2
)
The
patient
is
being
discharged
to
A
Hospital
where
she
will
receive
onsite
hemodialysis
three
times
per
week
on
Monday
,
Wednesday
and
Friday
.

The
nephrologist
who
will
follow
her
there
is
Dr.
Study
.

)
The
patient
will
continue
to
have
her
CBC
,
LDH
,
bilirubin
,
chem-7
and
magnesium
and
calcium
checked
with
each
dialysis
and
the
results
will
be
faxed
to
Dr.
Ian
Zineisfreierm
,
the
hematology
attending
at
fax
number
751-329-8840
.

4
)
The
patient
will
eventually
need
a
permanent
dialysis
fistula
.

The
left
subclavian
Tesio
which
she
has
in
place
will
last
for
several
months
in
the
mean
time
.

She
would
like
to
arrange
to
have
her
fistula
placed
at
Pre
Health
and
the
vascular
surgeons
there
should
be
contacted
regarding
this
.

5
)
The
patient
will
need
packed
red
blood
cell
transfusions
with
dialysis
when
her
hematocrit
falls
below
26
.

6
)
The
patient
will
continue
her
Prednisone
at
40
mg
p.o.
q.
day
times
one
month
(
this
was

on
HD#2
.

He
continued
to
undergo
BID
dressing
changes
.

Plastic
surgery
was
asked
to
evaluate
the
patient
.

Per
their
recommendations
,
silvadine
was
applied
to
the
tendons
to
prevent
dessication
.

Vascular
surgery
was
also
asked
to
evaluate
the
patient
's
right
lower
extremity
blood
flow
.

An
angiogram
on
HD#4
showed
severe
tibial
disease
and
moderate
SFA
disease
,
no
DP
artery
was
seen
.

The
vascular
team
recommended
a
femoral-peroneal
bypass
for
revascularization
and
performed
this
operation
on
HD#5
.

He
tolerated
the
procedure
well

course
of
Penicillin
G
and
Clindamycin
after
the
foot
was
completely
debrided
and
the
skin
flaps
completed
.

His
wound
continued
to
heal
well
and
by

#6
a
VAC
dressing
was
placed
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
61
-
year-old
white
male
with
a
history
of
coronary
artery
disease
,
status
post
5-vessel
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
on
2009-09-11
,
who
presents
for
elective
right
heart
catheterization
and
pericardiocentesis
.

The
patient
did
well
after
his
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
.

On
10-14
,
the
patient
had
a
transthoracic
echocardiogram
which
revealed
a
new
,
moderate-to-large
sized
pericardial
effusion
.

The
patient
was
asymptomatic
at
this
time
,
and
the
decision
was
made
to
monitor
him
and
to
start
him
on
Lasix
.

The
patient
had
follow-up
transthoracic
echocardiogram
on
11-04
which
revealed
a
slightly
large
effusion
.

A
few
days
later
,
on
11-07
,
the
patient
began
to
develop
dyspnea
on
exertion
with
normal
activity
.

He
also
noted
a
new
two
to
three-pillow
orthopnea
and
paroxysmal
nocturnal
dyspnea
.

On
11-08
,
he
had
an
episode
of
acute
shortness
of
breath
with
chest
pressure
which
he
describes
as
different
from
his
typical
angina
with
minimal
exertion
.

The
patient
spoke
with
his
cardiologist
who
referred
him
for
pericardiocentesis
for
persistent
and
symptomatic
pericardial
effusion
.

On
right
heart
catheterization
,
the
patient
was
noted
to
have
elevated
right-sided
and
left-sided
filling
pressures
with
a
pulmonary
capillary
wedge
pressure
of
19
and
a
right
atrial
pressure
of
16
.

After
600
cc
of
serosanguineous
pericardial
fluid
was
removed
,
the
patient
was
noted
to
have
a
pulmonary
capillary
wedge
pressure
of
9
and
a
right
atrial
pressure
of
2
;
indicating
resolution
of
tamponade
physiology
.

.

RADIOLOGY
/
IMAGING
:

The
patient
had
an
electrocardiogram
with
normal
sinus
rhythm
at
70
,
normal
axis
,
normal
intervals
,
low
voltage
in
the
limb
leads
.

Chest
x-ray
on
admission
revealed
a
large
left
pleural
effusion
.

The
patient
had
an
echocardiogram
on
11-10
which
revealed
the
following
:

Global
left
ventricular
systolic
function
appeared
grossly
preserved
.

Due
to
technical
quality
a
focal
wall
motion
abnormality
could
not
be
fully
excluded
.

The
aortic
valve
leaflets
were
mildly
thickened
.

The
mitral
valve
leaflets
were
mildly
thickened
.

There
was
a
large
pericardial
effusion
(
up
to
greater
than
6
cm
wide
anterior
to
the
right
ventricle
).

The
right
ventricle
was
compressed
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
transferred
to
the
Coronary
Care
Unit
after
his
therapeutic
pericardiocentesis
.

He
was
hemodynamically
stable
and
without
any
complaints
.

He
was
continued
on
his
home
cardiac
regimen
,
but
was
started
on
indomethacin
for
post
pericardiotomy
syndrome
.

Over
the
course
of
the
night
the
patient
drained
an
additional
400
cc
of
serosanguineous
fluid
from
his
pericardial
drain
pouch
.

By
the
next
morning
,
the
degree
of
drainage
had
decreased
considerably
with
only
60
cc
drained
over
six
hours
.

The
patient
had
a
repeat
transthoracic
echocardiogram
prior
to
drain
removal
which
revealed
the
following
:

A
trivial
/
physiologic
pericardial
effusion
one
day
post
pericardiocentesis
with
no
change
from
the
study
immediately
post
pericardiocentesis
.

The
pericardial
drain
was
removed
without
any
difficulty
.

The
pericardial
fluid
bag
was
removed
without
any
difficulty
with
the
decision
to
monitor
the
patient
overnight
and
repeat
the
echocardiogram
prior
to
discharge
.

The
patient
had
an
enlarged
left
pleural
effusion
which
was
noted
to
layer
on
a
lateral
decubitus
film
.

We
decided
to
perform
a
therapeutic
thoracentesis
.

The
patient
was
prepped
and
draped
in
a
sterile
fashion
,
and
1150
cc
of
fluid
were
drained
.

A
chest
x-ray
was
obtained
post
thoracentesis
which
revealed
a
significant
decrease
in
the
size
of
the
left
pleural
effusion
.

No
evidence
of
pneumothorax
.

On
the
morning
of
admission
the
patient
had
a
markedly
improved
lung
examination
with
increased
air
movement
in
the
left
base
.

He
denied
any
shortness
of
breath
and
had
oxygen
saturations
in
the
90
s
on
room
air
.

He
had
a
repeat
echocardiogram
which
revealed
a
trivial
/
physiologic
pericardial
effusion
.

The
patient
was
without
any
complaints
and
remained
stable
.

RUPTURED
PARATHYROID
ADENOMA
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Ms.
Shuffa
is
a
73-year-old
Portuguese
speaking
woman
who
was
transferred
via
Med
Flight
to
Verg
Medical
Center
.

She
arrived
intubated
and
was
hemodynamically
stable
despite
concerns
of
a
dissecting
aortic
arch
aneurysm
.

She
initially
presented
to
Brottlake
Medical
Center
on
9/15/00
complaining
of
acute
onset
dysphasia
to
liquids
and
solids
.

While
she
was
in
Brottlake
Medical
Center
,
she
developed
new
onset
stridor
,
and
an
ENT
consult
was
obtained
.

They
attempted
a
fiberoptic
intubation
with
a
#
6
endotracheal
tube
and
found
a
5
mm
severely
compressed
airway
.

She
was
also
found
to
have
a
differential
systolic
blood
pressure
and
ecchymosis
on
her
anterior
chest
.

Given
these
findings
,
she
underwent
a
CT
scan
which
showed
a
retrotracheal
mass
that
appeared
to
obliterate
the
esophagus
.

This
raised
concerns
for
a
hemorrhage
,
and
she
was
transferred
to
Verg
Medical
Center
emergently
.

At
the
Ingree
and
Ot
of
Weamanshy
Medical
Center
,
she
underwent
an
emergent
CT
scan
with
IV
contrast
.

This
revealed
no
extravasation
of
contrast
and
no
aortic
aneurysm
.

However
,
it
did
show
an
anterior
mediastinal
mass
compressing
the
trachea
with
a
density
consistent
with
a
hematoma
.

She
was
admitted
to
the
Thoracic
Surgery
Service
under
the
care
of
Dr.
Sccrookes
.

,
as
well
as
a
smaller

LABORATORY
DATA
:

CBC
was
8.7
,
25.3
,
and
184
.

Coags
12.2
,
24.8
,
and
1.0
.

Her
gas
was
7.47/40/332
.

Electrolytes
were
143
,
3.4
,
105
,
28
,
24
,
3
,
and
131
.

EKG
showed
normal
sinus
rhythm
with
left
ventricular
hypertrophy
and
incomplete
left
bundle
branch
block
.

CT
scan
showed
an
anterior
mediastinal
mass
compressing
the
trachea
with
air
.

It
was
consistent
with
a
hematoma
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

Ms.
Shuffa
underwent
an
EGD
and
flexible
bronchoscopy
on
9/16/00
shortly
after
she
arrived
.

This
showed
tracheal
compressions
but
no
other
lesions
that
were
obvious
at
the
time
.

She
was
hemodynamically
stable
and
remained
on
the
ventilator
.

The
differential
diagnoses
at
this
point
consisted
of
hematoma
vs.
neoplasm
vs.
an
abscess
vs.
a
thyroid
tumor
.

On
9/22/00
,
she
underwent
a
cervical
mediastinoscopy
.

A
biopsy
of
this
mass
was
consistent
with
hematoma
.

The
operative
report
shows
that
there
was
an
abnormal
area
below
the
trachea
to
the
left
which
represented
a
cavity
between
the
esophagus
,
trachea
,
aorta
,
and
spine
that
was
full
of
clot
.

There
was
no
active
bleeding
at
the
time
.

Over
the
next
several
days
,
the
patient
remained
hemodynamically
stable
on
the
ventilator
.

She
had
an
elevated
calcium
level
that
raised
the
suspicion
that
this
mass
could
be
a
hematoma
coming
from
a
ruptured
parathyroid
adenoma
.

The
ionized
calcium
was
elevated
as
was
the
parathormone
level
.

Given
these
findings
,
she
underwent
a
Sestamibi
scan
.

The
Sestamibi
scan
showed
findings
that
were
consistent
with
a
parathyroid
adenoma
in
the
right
lobe
of
the
thyroid
.

At
this
time
,
it
was
believed
that
her
clot
was
due
to
a
rupture
of
this
parathyroid
adenoma
.

Dr.
Ear
brought
the
patient
to
the
operating
room
on
10/5/00
.

She
underwent
a
parathyroid
exploration
with
resection
of
a
ruptured
ectopic
right
upper
parathyroid
adenoma
,
a
biopsy
of
a
normal
left
and
right
lower
parathyroids
,
resection
of
a
left
upper
parathyroid
,
and
tracheostomy
.

She
tolerated
the
procedure
well
and
was
transferred
back
to
the
Surgical
Intensive
Care
Unit
with
her
new
tracheostomy
working
well
.

Her
postoperative
course
was
complicated
by
serosanguineous
pleural
effusion
on
the
left
.

This
required
a
chest
tube
.

Her
hematocrit
continued
to
drop
over
the
next
couple
of
days
despite
normal
platelet
count
,
normal
coags
,
and
no
obvious
source
of
bleeding
.

It
was
believed
that
she
was
continuing
to
bleed
in
her
chest
.

However
,
we
are
not
quite
sure
why
this
was
occurring
.

She
underwent
an
extensive
workup
by
Hematology
that
revealed
a
bleeding
diatheses
of
unknown
etiology
.

It
turns
out
that
several
people
in
her
family
have
a
similar
bleeding
diathesis
of
unknown
etiology
.

In
conclusion
,
by
systems
:

1.
Neuro
.

The
patient
became
intermittently
agitated
.

We
have
been
giving
her
Haldol
at
bedtime
as
well
as
Ativan
p.r.n.
throughout
the
day
.

She
responds
well
to
this
.

She
speaks
some
English
and
seems
to
understand
more
than
she
speaks
.

She
has
a
family
member
who
is
present
for
approximately
12
hours
each
day
.

She
has
been
very
helpful
in
translating
and
seems
to
say
that
Ms.
Shuffa
is
in
good
spirits
.

2.
Cardiac
.

The
patient
&apos;s
blood
pressure
has
been
ranging
from
approximately
140
to
160
systolic
.

This
is
on
a
current
regimen
of
Lopressor
25
mg
per
NG
tube
t.i.d.
as
well
as
Diltiazem
60
mg
per
NG
tube
t.i.d.
,
and
lisinopril
10
mg
per
NG
tube
q.d.
She
occasionally
gets
hypertensive
when
she
is
agitated
.

For
this
,
we
have
given
her
10
mg
of
hydralazine
.

Her
blood
pressure
responds
well
to
this
.

Otherwise
,
she
is
in
normal
sinus
rhythm
and
has
been
hemodynamically
stable
throughout
her
hospitalization
.

The
patient
developed
a
left
femoral
artery
pseudoaneurysm
after
placement
of
a
Greenfield
filter
.

This
has
been
followed
by
the
Vascular
Surgery
Service
here
at
the
Ingree
and
Ot
of
Weamanshy
Medical
Center
.

Dr.
Lenni
Lung
has
been
consulted
.

The
aneurysm
at
the
time
of
discharge
is
approximately
2.5
cm
.

They
elected
not
to
inject
it
with
thrombin
.

They
asked
that
the
patient
follow-up
with
Dr.
Ear
in
approximately
three
to
four
weeks
so
that
this
aneurysm
can
be
assessed
.

They
have
opted
for
conservative
management
given
the
size
.

3.
Respiratory
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
the
patient
remained
on
CPAP
with
a
PEEP
of
7.5
and
a
pressure
support
of
9
.

She
seems
to
be
tolerating
this
well
as
she
has
an
O2
sat
of
100%
on
40%
FIO2
.

Her
chest
x-ray
shows
a
left
lower
lobe
hematoma
that
had
greatly
improved
in
the
last
few
days
.

Her
right
lung
field
is
clear
.

Her
tracheostomy
is
functioning
well
,
and
we
have
had
no
problems
with
it
.

She
will
obviously
need
to
be
weaned
as
tolerated
.

We
had
her
down
to
a
low
pressure
support
of
7
in
the
last
week
.

With
the
pressure
support
at
7
,
she
became
tachypneic
and
had
to
be
brought
back
up
to
10
.

Her
oxygen
saturation
has
always
been
good
.

4.
GI
.

The
patient
is
getting
tube
feeds
via
her
NG
tube
of
full
strength
Jevity
of
75
cc
per
hour
.

This
is
her
goal
.

She
tolerates
them
very
well
and
has
approximately
200
cc
to
300
cc
of
stool
per
day
.

Last
week
,
she
had
copious
amounts
of
stool
in
the
range
of
500
cc
to
1000
cc
of
liquid
stool
per
day
.

Stool
cultures
have
been
sent
numerous
times
as
well
as
analysis
for
C.
difficile
toxin
.

These
have
all
been
negative
.

We
believe
the
this
was
an
osmotic
diarrhea
.

Since
her
tube
feeds
have
been
changed
from
full
strength
Nephro
to
Jevity
,
her
diarrhea
has
resolved
.

She
has
been
taking
Zantac
,
and
the
pH
of
her
NG
tube
residuals
have
been
in
the
5
to
8
range
.

5.
GU
.

The
patient
has
had
hypernatremia
.

She
is
approximately
10
kg
up
her
overall
body
weight
.

We
believe
her
to
still
be
total
body
overloaded
.

Over
the
last
several
days
,
we
have
been
giving
her
approximately
500
cc
to
1000
cc
of
free
water
through
her
NG
tube
.

We
also
have
been
diuresing
her
with
Bumex
.

This
seems
to
trend
her
sodium
down
.

This
will
need
to
be
monitored
closely
.

Her
BUN
and
creatinine
have
been
normal
,
and
she
has
always
made
good
urine
.

6.
Heme
.

As
stated
before
,
the
patient
continued
to
ooze
into
her
pleural
space
well
after
her
definitive
operation
.

She
had
an
extensive
workup
by
Hematology
which
revealed
a
bleeding
diathesis
of
unknown
origin
.

Before
we
removed
her
chest
tube
,
we
had
to
give
her
platelets
.

She
had
no
problems
with
this
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
her
hematocrit
is
stable
in
the
28
to
33
range
.

I
stress
that
she
cannot
be
anticoagulated
.

We
have
given
her
Lovenox
in
the
past
,
and
she
continues
to
bleed
.

Therefore
,
she
is
on
no
DVT
prophylaxis
.

She
does
have
a
left
iliac
deep
vein
thrombosis
.

She
has
a
Greenfield
filter
in
place
,
and
this
is
her
only
DVT
prophylaxis
.

7.
ID
.

At
the
time
of
discharge
,
the
patient
has
a
urinary
tract
infection
.

She
is
growing
Enterobacter
cloacae
that
is
sensitive
only
to
Macrodantin
from
her
urine
cultures
.

Interestingly
enough
,
she
also
has
Enterobacter
cloacae
growing
out
of
her
sputum
.

This
is
also
sensitive
only
to
Macrodantin
.

We
do
not
believe
that
she
has
any
respiratory
process
going
on
at
the
time
.

She
is
just
begun
on
Macrodantin
at
the
day
of
discharge
and
should
continue
100
mg
per
NG
tube
q.i.d.
for
a
ten
day
course
.

Her
Foley
was
changed
the
day
before
discharge
.

8.
Tubes
,
lines
,
and
drains
.

The
patient
has
a
tracheostomy
,
NG
tube
,
and
a
Foley
catheter
.

Her
central
line
,
which
was
left
subclavian
quad
lumen
,
was
removed
on
the
day
of
discharge
.

.

He
is
71
inches
tall
,
196
lbs
.

He
has
no
carotid
bruits
.

Lungs
were
clear
bilaterally
.

Heart
is

,
without
murmur
.

Abdomen

,
nontender
with
a
pulsatile
mass
in
the

femoral
and
pedal
pulses
bilaterally
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
Vascular
Surgery
Service
as
a
same
day
admission
,
and
taken
to
the
operating
room
for
an
uncomplicated
endovascular
repair
of
his
abdominal
aortic
aneurysm
,
and
Anurx
modular
bifurcated
graft
was
placed
,
and
both
common
femoral
arteries
were
repaired
in
the
usual
fashion
.

He
had
pulsatile
pulse
volume
recordings
,
in
both
lower
extremities
,
and
both
renal
arteries
were
noted
to
be
patent
,
as
were
both
internal
iliac
arteries
.

His
angiogram
in
the
operating
room
,
revealed
no
evidence
of
an
endo
leak
.

Postoperatively
,
his
course
was
relatively
uncomplicated
.

He
did
have
an
episode
of
a
prolonged
sinus
pause
in
the
recovery
room
,
which
resulted
in
transient
loss
of
consciousness
.

He
responded
to
a
Neo-Synephrine
bolus
,
and
had
no
further
complications
from
this
standpoint
.

Dr.
Rosean
Fletcher
,
of
the
Cardiology
Department
was
consulted
,
and
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
sinus
pause
was
related
to
increased
vagal
tone
postoperatively
,
perhaps
secondary
to
the
epidural
,
as
well
as
the
patient
&apos;s
Atenolol
use
.

His
Atenolol
was
held
,
and
he
had
no
further
pauses
during
his
stay
.

His
postoperative
CT
scan
showed
no
evidence
of
endo
leak
,
or
graft
kinking
.

He
maintained
good
peripheral
pulses
and
warm
feet
postoperatively
.

However
,
he
did
develop
significant
ecchymosis
in
both
groins
,
extending
down
into
his
scrotum
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
significant
groin
hematomas
.

He
tolerated
a
regular
diet
.

His
pain
was
adequately
controlled
with
oral
medications
.

Accordingly
,
the
patient
was
discharged
to
home
on
postoperative
day
2
.

He
will
be
visited
by
LDAMC
for
blood
pressure
and
incision
checks
.

He
will
follow
up
with
Dr.
Dye
in
the
Clinic
.

ST
segments
with
evolution
of
Q
waves
.

Her
dopamine
was
weaned
off
the
following
day
,
and
her
heparin
was
discontinued
secondary
to
a
right
groin
hematoma
which
had
developed
after
the
sheath
had
been
pulled
out
by
the
fellow
.

Her
creatine
kinases
climbed
;
reaching
a

artery
disease
,
status
post
catheterization
,
she
was
given
Integrilin
for
18
hours
.

She
was
continued
on
aspirin
,
Plavix
,
and
Lipitor
.

For
her
rhythm
,
amiodarone
was
discontinued
as
she
was
maintained
in
sinus
rhythm
after
moving
to
the
floor
.

For
pump
,
once
transferred
out

12.5
mg
of
Lopressor
p.o.
b.i.d.
which
was
titrated
to
25
mg
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

Also
,
at
the
time
of
discharge
,
for
increased
afterload
reduction
,
she
was
started
on
lisinopril
5
mg
p.o.
q.d.

On
2011-11-21
,
the
patient
experienced
atypical
chest
pain
which
was
made
worse
with
inspiration
and
movement
.

It
was
not
associated
with
any
nausea
or
vomiting
.

It
did
not
radiate
.

It
was
felt
to
be
pain
secondary
to
her
self-extubation
and
noncardiac
chest
pain
.

An
electrocardiogram
was
checked
which
revealed
no
ST
changes
,
and
there
was
no
increase
in
her
downward
trending
creatine
phosphokinases
.

No
further
intervention
was
done
.

The
patient
was
treated
with
Tylenol
orally
as
well
as
Ativan
for
anxiety
that
she
had
about
going
home
.

She
was
pain
free
on
the
day
of
discharge
.

Regarding
her
aortic
ascending
aneurysm
,
Cardiothoracic
Surgery
was
consulted
regarding
further
workup
.

At
their
request
,
a
CT
scan
of
the
chest
with
contrast
was
performed
on
the
day
of
discharge
.

Dr.
Streeter
from
Cardiothoracic
Surgery
will
follow
up
with
the
patient
for
further
management
in
approximately
one
month
as
an
outpatient
.

His
office
will
contact
her
to
make
that
appointment
.

2.
PULMONARY
SYSTEM
:

As
stated
above
,
the
patient
self-extubated
herself
.

She
complained
of
a
sore
throat
which
was
likely
the
etiology
of
her
atypical
chest
complaints
.

This
resolved
with
Tylenol
and
as
needed
doses
of
oxycodone
.

Her
lungs
remained
clear
to
auscultation
bilaterally
throughout
the
remainder
of
her
hospital
course
.

At
the
time
of
this
dictation
,
the
CT
of
her
chest
was
still
pending
.

The
official
result
was
not
yet
in
.

3.
FLUIDS
/
ELECTROLYTES
/
NUTRITION
:

The
patient
's
electrolytes
sere
managed
daily
and
repleted
on
an
as
needed
basis
.

She
did
receive
intravenous
K-Phos
for
a
low
phosphorous
of
1.5
.

Her
phosphorous
rose
appropriately
to
3.6
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

DISCHARGE
FOLLOWUP
:

1.
The
patient
has
an
appointment
to
initiate
primary
care
,
as
she
no
longer
had
a
primary
care
physician
.

Claire
was
to
see
Dr.
Michael
Majerowski
at
the
Sturdy
Memorial
Clinic
on
the
east
campus
,
on
Bissonette

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

This
is
a
75
year
old
righthanded
Caucasian
female
who
was
admitted
to
the
Fairm
of
Ijordcompmac
Hospital
because
of
left
facial
droop
and
hand
weakness
after
glaucoma
laser
surgery
.

She
was
transferred
to
the
Sas
General
Hospital
for
further
evaluation
of
some
weakness
in
the
setting
of
multiple
medical
problems
.

The
patient
had
o.d.
glaucoma
surgery
,
1400
hours
,
on
May
12th
,
1992
.

Soon
after
surgery
,
the
patient
noted
her
left
lower
face
and
hand
were
weak
.

She
was
brought
to
the
emergency
room
where
she
was
evaluated
and
determined
to
have
had
a
cerebrovascular
accident
.

She
has
absolutely
no
neurologic
disease
in
past
.

The
review
of
systems
is
negative
.

However
,
two
days
prior
to
admission
,
one
family
member
noted
that
the
patient
had
a
transient
left
facial
droop
.

A
potassium
three
days
prior
to
surgery
was
2.8
,
the
level
being
normalized
with
p.o.
kay
ciel
prior
to
admission
.

PAST
MEDICAL
HISTORY
:

The
patient

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

#
1.
cerebrovascular
accident
.

The
patient
suffered
some
mild
weakness
which
was
attributed
to
stenosis
of
the
distal
right
internal
carotid
artery
.

This
was
determined
by
head
CT
,
head
MRI
,
head
MRA
,
carotid
noninvasive
studies
,
transcranial
Dopplers
.

The
possibility
of
a
cardiac
origin
was
evaluated
by
echocardiogram
and
Holter
monitor
.

Her
echocardiogram
curiously
showed
a
normal
left
ventricular
size
and
systolic
function
,
a
patent
foramen
ovale
,
with
a
trace
right
to
left
shunt
,
as
determined
by
bubble
study
,
trace
MR
was
present
.

Previous
echoes
have
shown
MVP
at
the
Ona
Hospital
.

Her
Holter
showed
up
to
12
beats
of
SVT
,
but
was
otherwise
unremarkable
.

The
patient
had
a
normal
B12
,
negative
syphilis
serologies
and
normal
thyroid
function
during
this
hospitalization
.

She
was
anticoagulated
with
heparin
and
after
several
days
Coumadin
was
started
.

Her
exact
Coumadin
dose
is
undetermined
at
this
point
,
however
it
looks
like
it
will
be
something
around
5
mg
a
day
.

Her
pro
time
and
PTT
have
normalized
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

She
needs
to
be
given
5
mg
of
Coumadin
tonight
,
5/22/92
.

In
addition
heparin
should
be
started
to
drip
on
arrival
at
400
units
an
hour
.

It
is
discontinued
at
the
time
of
transport
.

The
patient
has
received
physical
therapy
and
occupational
therapy
and
her
recovery
is
near
complete
.

During
evaluation
of
her
neurologic
status
,
it
was
determined
that
for
several
months
prior
to
admission
,
the
patient
has
been
too
unsteady
to
ambulate
.

On
our
exam
she
is
found
to
have
a
significant
amount
of
ataxia
,
especially
in
the
midline
and
the
exact
cause
of
this
is
unknown
.

There
are
multiple
possible
contributions
and
this
is
where
her
need
for
careful
internal
medical
evaluation
has
arisen
.

At
the
time
we
were
to
embark
on
this
evaluation
,
the
patient
&apos;s
family
strongly
requested
that
she
be
transferred
to
the
Sas
General
Hospital
.

What
follows
is
a
summary
of
her
medical
problems
and
their
possible
relationship
to
her
ataxia
.

Her
ataxia
is
likely
due
to
some
cerebellar
function
,
though
this
is
not
certain
.

Moreover
her
MRI
did
not
show
any
discrete
cerebellar
lesions
.

Our
leading
theory
at
this
point
is
that
her
cerebellar
dysfunction
relates
to
perineoplastic
syndrome
,
relating
to
her
history
of
breast
Ca
.

As
I
mentioned
above
,
her
evaluation
was
limited
by
her
cardiologic
status
at
the
time
.

While
mammogram
and
CA-15.3
and
breast
exam
are
all
normal
,
the
idea
of
a
perineoplastic
syndrome
with
or
without
concomitant
breast
Ca
has
reared
its
head
.

Two
possible
markers
are
anti-Hu
syndrome
and
anti-Yo
antibody
.

These
tests
were
sent
on
the
18th
and
are
pending
at
the
time
of
discharge
.

The
results
can
be
obtained
by
paging
me
,
Do
A.
Joasscchird
,
M.D.
at
834-364-2251
.

I
will
be
happy
to
furnish
the
results
.

The
patient
has
a
history
of
MI
in
1989
.

Echocardiogram
no
longer
shows
wall
motion
abnormalities
.

EKG
,
when
the
patient
goes
out
of
left
bundle
branch
block
transiently
shows
an
anterolateral
Q/wave
inversion
.

We
would
like
to
discontinue
her
Isordil
to
improve
upon
some
orthostatic
hypotension
,
but
we
are
not
certain
whether
her
heart
will
tolerate
this
.

Persantine
thallium
is
scheduled
at
this
time
,
but
is
yet
to
be
performed
.

The
patient
has
a
history
of
orthostatic
hypotension
x
many
years
.

It
has
been
evaluated
in
the
past
without
success
.

During
her
hospitalization
,
we
confirmed
the
presence
of
this
,
even
when
she
was
hydrated
with
saline
,
to
a
fractional
excretion
of
sodium
of
2%
.

Studies
of
her
autonomic
system
did
not
document
any
dysautonomia
.

Studies
of
skin
galvanic
conduction
were
normal
and
her
RR
interval
evaluation
was
not
abnormal
.

This
is
a
chronic
problem
but
may
be
contributing
to
her
current
weakness
and
inability
to
walk
.

Florinef
is
to
be
considered
,
however
stopping
the
Isordil
is
one
goal
.

The
patient
has
a
history
of
bronchiectasis
from
a
childhood
pneumonia
.

In
addition
there
is
a
distant
history
of
M.
kansasaii
infection
.

This
has
been
evaluated
by
Dr.
Screen
at
Sas
General
Hospital
and
probably
relates
to
her
lung
xray
.

CT
at
the
Ona
Hospital
in
1989
showed
similar
findings
.

A
chest
CT
was
to
be
performed
and
may
be
yielding
.

A
PPD
was
placed
and
is
to
be
read
on
Saturday
,
4
26th
.

The
left
volar
forearm
has
the
PPD
just
proximal
to
the
wrist
crease
and
a
candida
albicans
placed
just
distal
to
the
antecubital
fossa
.

The
patient
has
a
history
of
deep
venous
thrombosis
in
1990
,
for
which
she
received
6
months
of
Coumadin
.

Dopplers
of
her
lower
extremities
were
negative
on
this
admission
.

It
is
doubtful
that
she
has
chronic
PE
,
but
this
is
one
consideration
.

It
is
likely
that
she
has
pulmonary
hypertension
from
her
lung
disease
,
and
so
this
is
a
consideration
.

The
patient
had
mild
hyponatremia
during
this
hospitalization
with
a
sodium
as
low
as
131
.

We
think
this
is
likely
due
to
an
SIADH
as
she
is
euvolemic
.

This
can
be
evaluated
further
and
is
not
a
problem
at
this
time
.

The
patient
has
glaucoma
.

Her
medications
are
as
listed
below
.

Her
ophthalmologist
is
aware
of
transfer
.

His
name
is
Ettrent
Can
and
he
can

Brief
Hospital
Course
:

1)
GI
-
In
the
Monica
pt
had
Hct
of
20
and
bloody
NG
lavage
which
did
not
clear
.

She
was
transfused
1U
PRBC
,
GI
consult
called
,
also
got
zofran
and
iv
protonix
and
admitted
to
the
FICU
.

On
arrival
to
unit
pt
had
EGD
which
revealed
grade
III
esophageal
varices
with
signs
of
old
bleeding
.

She
was
started
on
octreotide
and
nadolol
to
control
portal
htn
.

Pt
was
stable
and
had
appropriate
Hct
bump
to
25
after
2U
PRBC
's.

She
also
had
climbing
bilirubin
and
low
grade
temp
and
was
started
on
Zosyn
for
suspected
biliary
obstruction
and
ascending
cholangitis
coverage
.

She
was
rescoped
on
10-28
and
varices
were
sclerosed
(
no
banding
due
to
latex
allergy
)
and
diuretics
of
lasix
and
aldactone
were
readded
for
ascites
since
BP
stable
.

10-29
she
was
transfused
another
3U
PRBC
's
with
hct
bump
to
31.9
and
antibiotic
coverage
broadend
to
Unasyn
,
Ceftriaxone
,
Flagyl
because
she
continued
to
spike
,
and
for
SBP
prophylaxis
.

Preprocedure
of
PTC
on
10-30
she
was
transfused
1
unit
PRBC
's,
2
platelets
and
2U
FFP
and
procedure
went
without
complication
.

ON
transfer
to
the
floor
she
remained
hemodynamically
stable
with
stable
Hct
and
declining
bilirubin
.

She
remained
afebrile
so
on
11-02
antibiotic
regimen
was
weaned
to
only
levofloxacin
.

Liver
teams
recommended
to
repeat
EGD
with
non
latex
banding
in
7-10
days
.

She
also
went
home
on
naldolol
20
mg
qd
for
portal
htn
,
and
her
home
doses
of
diuretics
to
control
her
ascites
.

2.
US
finding
-
Pt
was
incidentally
found
to
have
R
hydronephrosis
and
a
R
adenexal
mass
on
her
US
.

The
hydronephrosis
was
likely
caused
by
blockage
by
her
tumor
.

Given
her
disease
prognosis
and
the
fact
that
her
other
kidney
is
functioning
well
,
no
intervention
was
done
.

Also
the
adenexal
mass
may
represent
a
second
primary
maligancy
.

This
was
seen
on
a
prior
CT
scan
and
her
oncologist
is
aware
.

Again
given
the
patient
's
poor
disease
prognosis
,
there
was
no
intervention
made
at
this
time
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
69-year-old
male
with
multiple
medical
problems
and
known
transfusion
dependent
secondary
to
myelodysplastic
syndrome
admitted
with
decreased
hematocrit
.

The
patient
has
had
multiple
previous
admissions
for
cardiac
and
pulmonary
disease
.

He
has
had
chronic
anemia
since
1990
,
but
a
bone
marrow
biopsy
in
07-92
,
was
consistent
with
myelodysplastic
syndrome
.

Over
the
past
several
months
,
the
patient
has
had
increasing
transfusing
requirements
.

His
transfusions
have
been
complicated
by
fluid
overload
and
congestive
heart
failure
,
secondary
to
ischemia
cardiomyopathy
.

His
last
admission
was
9-14-93
,
for
a
transfusion
without
complications
,
and
prior
to
admission
the
patient
reports
having
several
days
of
increasing
weakness
,
dizziness
and
fatigue
.

His
wife
says
his
hands
and
lips
have
been
blue
.

Apparently
,
he
had
had
a
low
hematocrit
as
an
outpatient
and
was
checked
two
weeks
prior
to
admission
but
was
not
given
transfusion
because
the
patient
did
not
want
to
come
in
at
that
time
.

Aside
from
the
above
,
the
patient
had
felt
that
baseline
without
fever
and
chills
or
change
in
chronic
cough
.

He
had
no
increase
in
his
congestive
heart
failure
symptoms
,
no
chest
pain
,
and
no
hemoptysis
or
changed
in
arthritis
.

The
patient
did
report
taking
a
po
antibiotic
(
Ciprofloxacin
)
for
right
great
toe
infection
(

from
his
baseline
EKG
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
and
placed
in
isolation
on
neutropenic
precautions
.

He
was
transfused
with
1/2
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
and
given
Lasix
periodically
to
prevent
him
from
going
into
congestive
heart
failure
has
he
had
on
his
prior
transfusion
.

Because
his
need
for
multiple
transfusionsm
he
was
transfused
with
radiated
Leuco
four
units
.

The
patient
had
a
good
bump
in
his
hematocrit
,
more
than
expected
from
22
to
high
20
&apos;s
range
next
day
after
3
1/2
units
,
but
later
that
evening
had
a
drop
in
his
hematocrit
so
was
given
4
more
1/2
units
at
this
point
for
a
total
of
4
units
packed
red
blood
cells
.

He
again
did
not
bump
his
hematocrit
sufficiently
and
remained
in
the
high
20
&apos;s
after
a
total
of
4
units
,
so
he
was
given
2
more
total
units
in
1/2
units
segments
the
following
day
.

His
hematocrit
subsequently
bumped
to
greater
than
30
and
was
discharged
with
hematocrit
of
32
on
11-7-93
.

The
patient
remained
asymptomatic
from
a
CHF
stand
point
and
felt
much
better
after
the
transfusions
.

It
is
unclear
why
the
patient
did
not
bump
his
hematocrit
more
but
he
did
not
appear
to
be
hemolyzing
from
laboratory
data
,
that
is
his
LDH
was
within
normal
limits
.

In
addition
,
multiple
stools
were
guaiaced
and
were
all
guaiac
negative
.

The
patient
was
discharged
with
follow-up
with
his
Hematologist
,
Dr.
Eci
Area
and
Rheumatologist
,
Dr.
Taange

HISTORY
OF
THE
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Mr.
Vinktlandfreierm
was
admitted
from
Owaleharbo
Tanaminer
Hospital
to
which
he
had
been
discharged
approximately
four
days
prior
to
admission
.

He
was
noted
to
have
dark
stools
per
rectum
and
to
be
somewhat
fluid
overloaded
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

He
was
admitted
and
found
to
have
a
significant
hematocrit
drop
from
33.8
to
24.3
.

He
was
found
operation
be
short
of
breath
and
was
taken
to
dialysis
for
apparent
fluid
overload
.

His
gastrointestinal
bleeding
issues
were
investigated
with
an
upper
endoscopy
which
revealed
multiple
superficial
gastric
ulcerations
consistent
with
an
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
gastropathy
.

He
had
been
discharged
on
one
aspirin
a
day
with
20
of
Prilosec
b.i.d.

The
aspirin
was
discontinued
and
he
had
no
further
problems
with
gastrointestinal
bleeding
and
a
stable
hematocrit
the
rest
of
his
hospitalization
.

During
the
course
of
his
hospitalization
,
he
became
increasingly
lethargic
.

An
extensive
work-up
was
done
for
any
metabolic
abnormalities
which
was
unrevealing
.

He
responded
somewhat
to
lactulose
for
hepatic
encephalopathy
.

He
had
one
positive
blood
culture
for
Vancomycin
resistant
enterococcus
.

In
the
few
days
prior
to
his
demise
,
he
was
intermittently
somewhat
lethargic
buton
the
morning
of
June
25
,
1999
,
his
white
count
was
noted
to
have
increased
from
8
to
13,000
.

That
day
,
he
was
found
to
be
acutely
short
of
breath
with
a
respiratory
rate
of
40
and
oxygen
saturations
in
the
mid
seventies
.

He
was
put
on
100%
nonrebreather
and
his
oxygen
saturations
improved
to
the
low
nineties
.

Nasal
trumpet
suction
was
done
and
he
was
found
to
have
food
like
material
that
was
easily
suctioned
out
.

He
was
also
found
to
havesome
pieces
of
toast
in
his
mouth
.

Blood
gases
were
done
and
he
was
found
to
have
a
pH
of
7.2
with
a
pCO2
of
21
.

Fingerstick
glucose
revealed
a
sugar
of
12
.

A
stat
panel
7
confirmed
that
the
sugar
was
23
and
that
he
had
a
new
anion
gap
of
40
.

Repeat
blood
gas
was
done
which
was
almost
identical
to
the
first
.

The
family
was
called
and
came
in
to
see
the
patient
.

An
extensive
family
meeting
was
held
and
the
family
agreed
that
it
did
not
make
sense
to
intubate
the
patient
and
send
him
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

In
the
acute
setting
,
he
had
been
started
on
levofloxacin
,
Flagyl
,
and
Vancomycin
.

These
antibiotics
were
continued
but
the
family
decided
that
they
wanted
us
to
emphasize
the
comfort
of
the
patient
and
pursue
no
further
invasive
measures
.

The
patient
was
made
do
not
resuscitate
/
do
not
intubate
.

At
2:30
on
June
26
,
1999
,
I
was
called
to
see
the
patient
who
had
expired
.

DISPOSITION
:

The
family
was
notified
and
came
in
to
see
the
patient
.

The
family
declined
an
autopsy
saying
that
they
felt
that
the
patient
had
been
through
enough
.

The
patient
&apos;s
attending
physician
,
Dr.
Erm
Neidwierst
,
was
notified
as
well
.

and
found
his
blood
sugar
at
the
time
to
be
61
and
noted

He
has
been
depressed
recently
regarding
stress
with
his
home
life
and
on
the
night
of
his
extra
insulin
doses
,
his
wife
had
just
kicked
him
out

He
has
had
four
past
hospitalizations
for
attempted
suicide
with
insulin
overdosing

,
he
received
3.5
amps
of
D50
and
then
D5
normal
saline
and
D10
normal
saline
with
blood
sugars
that
were
slow
to
increase
leading
the
ICU
team
to
suspect
that

had
taken
more
insulin
than
he
admitted

tox
screen
for
alcohol

dizziness
currently
,
neck

episodes
of

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

1.
HYPOGLYCEMIA
:

The
patient
had
been
initially
very
hypoglycemic
on
admission
secondary
to
overdosing
on
insulin
;
however
,
with
glucose
repletion
both
in
the
Emergency
Department
and
in
the
ICU
,
this
resolved
and
the
patient
also
began
to
eat
.

We
checked
fingerstick
glucoses
q.i.d.
and
at
3:00
a.m.

His
glucose
on
the
morning
of
discharge
was
about
60
so
we
opted
to
decrease
his
p.m.
NPH
dose
slightly
for
discharge
and
continue
covering
him
with
sliding
scale
insulin
.

He
should
also
continue
having
a
snack
at
midnight
if
able
.

It
is
likely
that
he
required
a
much
greater
amount
of
insulin
as
an
outpatient
due
to
poor
compliance
with
Richard
Natalie
diet
.

2.
ALCOHOL
ABUSE
:

It
is
likely
that
the
patient
continues
to
drink
more
than
he
admits
.

He
did
have
past
alcoholism
consisting
of
a
half
a
pint
of
brandy
per
day
for
three
years
but
supposedly
had
quit
in
2009-09-03
.

He
had
been
on
a
diazepam
CIWA
scale
prophylaxis
against
DT
s;
however
,
he
had
a
very
low
CIWA
scale
during
his
entire
admission
and
did
not
need
any
benzodiazepines
.

This
alcohol
abuse
may
be
further
addressed
as
an
inpatient
on
the
Psychiatry
Quincy
Medical
Center
.

We
had
also
requested
a
Social
Work
consult
regarding
this
.

3.
DEPRESSION
vs.
Borderline
personality
disorder
:

The
patient
has
had
several
admissions
in
the
past
for
attempted
suicide
with
overdose
of
his
insulin
and
though
he
denied
at
this
time
attempting
to
end
his
life
,
it
appears
that
the
social
situation
of
increased
stressors
corresponding
to
this
time
suggest
that
this
is
not
the
truth
.

He
received
a
one-to-one
sitter
during
his
admission
and
will
be
transferred
to
the
Psychiatry
HealthSouth
New
England
Rehab
Hospital
to
ensure
the
patient
's
safety
and
initiate
further
antidepressant
treatment
.

He
will
need
close
follow-up
regarding
his
depression
as
an
outpatient
,
although
apparently
this
has
been
set
up
for
him
in
the
past
and
he
had
not
followed
through
.

4.
HISTORY
OF
HIGH
BLOOD
PRESSURE
:

His
blood
pressure
was
fairly
low
with
a
maximum
of
130s
systolic
during
his
admission
,
thus
we
did
not
continue
his
lisinopril
which
he
had
been
on
in
the
past
.

5.
RIGHT
UPPER
QUADRANT
PAIN
:

We
obtained
a
right
upper
quadrant
ultrasound
as
well
as
LFTs
,
amylase
,
and
lipase
which
were
all
normal
.

He
had
no
evidence
of
cholecystitis
or
gallstones
or
any
abnormalities
with
the
liver
or
kidneys
.

it
is
possible
that
he
has
had
a
muscle
strain
or
other
musculoskeletal
cause
.

6.
PROPHYLAXIS
:

He
was
put
on
Pepcid
for
GI
prophylaxis
.

7.
FLUIDS
,
ELECTROLYTES
,
AND
NUTRITION
:

He
complied
with
Linda
Chad
diet
while
hospitalized
.

The
patient
was
hyperphosphatemic
secondary
to
overadministration
of
Neutra-Phos
during
his
ICU
stay
.

He
was
given
two
doses
of
calcium
carbonate
1
gram
,
and
will
most
likely
normalize
secondary
to
both
calcium
binding
and
urinary
excretion
.

He
has
been
asymptomatic
.

On

was
admitted
to
Dr.
Liley
&apos;s

.

At
that
time
he
was
made
NPO
with
IVF
,
placed
on
Ampicillin
/
Levofloxacin
/
Flagyl
and
underwent
IR
placement
of
a
drainage
catheter
for
his
abdominopelvic
fluid
collection
.

Overnight
he
spiked
a
fever
to
103
and
his
WBC
climbed
from
11
to
13
.

As
a
result
,
IR
reviewed
the
patient
&apos;s
post-procedure
imaging
and
felt
that
the
catheter
was
not
adequately
draining
the
patient
&apos;s
fluid
collection
.

On
04/07
they
took
the
patient
back
to
the
IR
suite
and
placed
a
second
catheter
.

The
location
of
the
second
catheter
was
confirmed
that
evening
by
a
follow-up
scan
which
revealed
good
placement
.

The
following
day
the
patient
defervesced
.

Neurologic
:

The

:

After
catheter
placement
,
the
patient
was
started
on
sips
.

He
tolerated
this
well
.

He
was
advanced
to
clears
which
he
tolerated
and
was
restarted
on
a
low
residue
diet
.

His
bowel
function
resumed
and
in
fact
he
had
loose
stool
.

He
had
3
specimens
sent
for
C.
difficile
which
were
negative
.

GU
:

The
patient
&apos;s
electrolytes
and
fluids
were
monitored
closely
during
his
admission
.

Heme
:

The
patient
&apos;s
WBC
trended
down
to
10.7
at
discharge
from
a
peak
of
13
on
04/07
.

His
hematocrit
remained
stable
.

He
received
DVT
prophylaxis
with
SC
Heparin
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
was
a
71
year
old
white
female
with
a
history
of
carcinoid
lung
cancer
who
presented
for
evaluation
of
a
tracheoesophageal
fistula
.

The
patient
was
initially
diagnosed
in
1978
with
atypical
small
cell
carcinoma
of
the
lung
and
treated
with
chemotherapy
and
radiation
therapy
until
1980
.

She
did
well
for
approximately
twelve
years
until
she
was
diagnosed
with
carcinoid
cancer
of
the
same
right
upper
lobe
.

This
may
have
been
the
initial
primary
cancer
although
it
is
unclear
at
present
.

Bronchoscopy
at
that
time
showed
an
endobronchial
tumor
of
the
right
upper
lobe
bronchus
and
it
was
felt
to
be
unresectable
.

She
underwent
four
treatments
of
brachytherapy
in
March
through
May
of
1993
.

She
had
been
doing
reasonably
well
until
December
of
1993
when
she
presented
with
persistent
and
worsening
cough
and
near
strangulation
on
attempts
at
eating
solids
or
drinking
liquids
.

A
bronchoscopy
showed
a
tracheoesophageal
fistula
with
an
opening
into
the
trachea
above
the
carina
and
no
tumor
in
the
right
upper
lobe
.

She
has
been
on
total
parenteral
nutrition
and
has
been
nothing
by
mouth
since
then
.

A
barium
swallow
prior
to
admission
showed
the
presence
of
a
tracheoesophageal
fistula
with
entrance
into
the
right
mainstem
bronchus
below
the
carina
.

PAST
MEDICAL
HISTORY
:

Bronchitis
,
asthma
,

,
throat
examination
was
unremarkable
.

Neck
shows
a
well
healed
low
collar
incision
without
adenopathy
or
bruit
.

The
lungs
showed
mild
inspiratory
wheeze
and
moderate
expiratory
wheezes
.

Breath

are
present
bilaterally
.

Cardiovascular
exam
:

regular

.

The
abdomen
was
soft
,
nontender
,
nondistended
.

Extremities
:

no
clubbing
,
cyanosis
or

.

The
rectal
examination
is
guaiac

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
admitted
on
February
5
,
1994
and
had
a
central
venous
line
placed
in
her
right
subclavian
.

The
patient
was
brought
to
the
Operating
Room
on
February
6
,
1994
where
she
underwent
rigid
and
flexible
bronchoscopy
and
upper
gastrointestinal
endoscopy
.

Findings
included
necrotic
debris
in
the
distal
trachea
at
the
carina
and
right
mainstem
bronchus
.

Esophageal
mucosa
was
visible
through
the
trachea
.

Her
steroids
were
weaned
and
the
patient
was
brought
to
the
Operating
Room
on
February
10
,
1994
where
she
underwent
once
again
flexible
bronchoscopy
and
flexible
esophagoscopy
,
as
well
as
rigid
bronchoscopy
.

She
then
had
a
transhiatal
esophagectomy
which
was
partial
,
and
a
substernal
gastric
interposition
as
well
as
a
jejunostomy
.

The
pathology
report
suggested
that
the
area
was
involved
with
radiation
esophagitis
and
focal
ulceration
.

She
remained
ventilator
dependent
postoperatively
and
was
taken
to
the
Respiratory
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

The
patient
was
maintained
on
triple
antibiotics
which
included
Vancomycin
,
ceftazidime
and
Gentamicin
.

On
postoperative
day
two
,
she
had
an
electroencephalogram
which
showed
no
evidence
of
seizure
activity
but
some
generalized
slowing
.

The
patient
was
seen
in
consultation
by
the
Neurology
Service
for
her
apparent
postoperative
encephalopathy
and
episodes
of
shaking
.

An
endoscopy
was
also
performed
on
postoperative
day
two
which
showed
clean
anastomosis
.

She
received
multiple
bronchoscopies
for
pulmonary
toilet
.

The
patient
was
maintained
on
tube
feedings
and
the
ventilator
.

A
repeat
echocardiogram
on
February
18
showed
no
significant
change
of
her
previous
echocardiogram
on
February
11
,
which
showed
only
a
small
pericardial
effusion
.

A
pelvic
and
abdominal
computerized
tomography
scan
on
February
18
also
showed
no
evidence
of
a
focal
collection
or
abscess
.

She
remained
intermittently
febrile
despite
numerous
antibiotics
.

Her
chest
X-ray
showed
bilateral
air
space
disease
,
consistent
with
pneumonia
or
adult
respiratory
distress
syndrome
.

She
suffered
an
episode
of
renal
failure
which
was
felt
attributable
to
aminoglycoside
toxicity
.

Her
steroids
were
weaned
.

Because
of
her
prolonged
intubation
and
inability
to
wean
,
on
February
24
,
1994
,
she
had
a
tracheostomy
placed
.

She
remained
in
a
coma
.

The
blood
cultures
on
February
26
,
1994
grew
out
Staphylococcus
and
she
was
treated
for
septicemia
.

Her
sputum
grew
out
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
as
well
.

The
urine
contained
yeast
and
she
was
treated
with
amphotericin
.

On
March
3
,
1994
,
a
repeat
chest
and
abdominal
and
pelvis
computerized
tomography
scan
showed
no
evidence
of
fluid
collections
.

There
was
a
large
left
pleural
effusion
however
.

This
was
drained
with
a
left
chest
tube
.

Her
sputum
then
grew
out
Klebsiella
and
she
was
treated
with
amikacin
and
imipenem
.

She
developed
a
right
pleural
effusion
and
had
a
right
chest
tube
placed
.

On
March
13
,
1994
,
she
regained
some
level
of
consciousness
.

She
was
able
to
fix
and
follow
with
her
eyes
,
respond
to
commands
.

On
March
14
,
1994
,
her
right
lung
was
pleurodesed
.

Attempts
were
made
to
facilitate
her
wean
by
resting
her
overnight
with
a
combination
of
propafol
and
Fentanyl
.

This
was
tried
for
approximately
seven
days
with
no
real
progress
made
toward
facilitating
her
vent
wean
.

She
continued
to
require
pressor
support
in
the
high
30
&apos;s
.

She
also
fell
into
a
coma
once
again
.

On
March
31
,
1994
,
her
pressor
support
requirement
increased
and
she
continued
to
have
tachypneic
episodes
.

On
April
2
,
1994
,
she
had
several
episodes
of
bradycardia
and
asystole
,
which
responded
only
to
manual
ventilation
.

Discussions
were
held
with
the
patient
&apos;s
family
with
regard
to
her
previously
expressed
wishes
not
to
be
maintained
on
artificial
life
support
for
extended
period
of
time
with
little
or
no
hope
for
recovery
.

She
had
expressed
these
wishes
in
writing
on
several
legal
forms
from
the
state
of
Jose
Pineston
,
as
well
as
in
discussions
with
her
loved
ones
.

Decision
was
made
in
conjunction
with
the
family
and
Dr.
Caslighlourdes
to
terminate
artificial
respiratory
support
.

The
patient
was
removed
from
the
ventilator
and
placed
on
a
T-piece
in
her
trachea
only
and
was
made
comfortable
with
narcotics
.

Her
respirations
ceased
and
she
died
at
10:15
a.m.
on
April
2
,
1994
.

DISPOSITION
/
PLAN
ON
DISCHARGE
:

The
family
will
return
the
body
to
Sa
for
burial
.

They
have
declined
a

DIAGNOSIS
:

Urinary

,
diabetes
mellitus
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

Mr.
Stain
was
transferred
from
the
Oreiewlefell
Merkane
I
Penaltbridgesgreat
University
Medical
Center
for
progressive
respiratory
failure
and
adult
respiratory
distress
syndrome
superimposed
on
a
history
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
,
perhaps
asthma
,
and
ulcerative
colitis
.

His
only
positive
result
was
a
sputum
culture
for
Pseudomonas
and
this
came
after
he
had
already
been
on
antibiotics
.

PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
:

The
physical
examination
on
transfer
showed
an
alert
male
with
temperature
100
degrees
,
blood
pressure
120/64
,
heart
rate
80
.

He
was
intubated
with
pressor
support
of
25
,
and
PEEP
of
12.5
with
70%
FIO2
.

Tracheostomy
tube
was
in
good
position
.

There
was
an
audible
air
leak
.

His
chest
showed
bilateral
rhonchi
.

The
abdomen
was
distended
with
active
bowel
sounds
.

The
rectal
examination
was
unremarkable
.

Extremities
showed
trace
pulmonary
edema
.

LABORATORY
DATA
:

A
chest
X-ray
showed
diffuse
bilateral
alveolar
infiltrates
,
greater
in
the
lower
lung
fields
than
in
the
upper
.

The
EKG
showed
normal
sinus
rhythm
at
83
,
with
an
11
degree
axis
,
non-specific
ST-T
wave
changes
.

The
sputum
Gram
stain
showed
a
few
polys
and
no
organisms
.

The
blood
gas
showed
a
pO2
of
56
,
pCO2
of
48
and
pH
of
7.47
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
seen
in
consultation
by
Dr.
Wire
who
felt
that
manipulation
of
the
tracheal
tube
was
the
best
approach
to
the
air
leak
since
it
was
a
new
trach
and
he
was
requiring
such
high
ventilator
support
that
it
was
risky
to
change
it
.

He
also
felt
that
lung
biopsy
at
this
time
was
rather
risky
.

The
patient
was
therefore
completely
cultured
again
and
begun
on
antibiotic
coverage
which
would
take
care
of
the
Pseudomonas
he
was
known
to
have
.

The
steroids
were
tapered
.

He
was
also
begun
on
anti-Candida
regimen
for
his
urinary
tract
infection
with
yeast
being
seen
.

Because
of
the
story
of
hemoptysis
,
he
also
underwent
an
exotic
bleeding
work
up
for
such
things
as
Wegner
&apos;s
and
Goodpasture
&apos;s
.

These
results
were
all
negative
.

He
continued
to
require
very
high
FIO2
.

He
was
found
to
have
a
DVT
by
ultrasound
.

He
underwent
a
trial
of
TPA
followed
by
heparin
.

This
produced
substantially
further
hemoptysis
and
the
need
for
transfusion
.

He
stabilized
from
this
,
but
on
the
fifth
while
continuing
to
have
extremely
ventilator
requirement
.

In
consultation
with
his
family
,
it
was
decided
that
enough
support
had
been
done
.

At
that
time
,
therefore
,
ventilator
support
was
withdrawn
under
the
comfort
measures
of
morphine
.

HISTORY
AND
REASON
FOR
HOSPITALIZATION
:

Granrivern
Call
is
a
79-year-old
right
handed
white
male
with
a
history
of
questionable
progressive
supranuclear
palsy
,
atrial
fibrillation
,
deep
venous
thrombosis
,
and
pulmonary
embolus
who
presents
with
a
change
in
mental
status
and
a
fall
at
home
.

His
family
stated
that
he
had
a
progressive
mental
decline
over
the
past
three
years
and
was
initially
diagnosed
with
Parkinson
&apos;s
disease
or
features
consistent
with
Parkinsonism
.

This
was
poorly
responsive
to
Eldopa
.

He
was
later
seen
by
Dr.
Flo
Cuchkote
at
the
Ph
University
Of
Medical
Center
and
diagnosed
with
progressive
supranuclear
palsy
.

Over
the
five
to
six
weeks
prior
to
admission
he
had
a
drop
off
in
his
mental
functioning
with
more
frequent
episodes
of
confusion
and
disorientation
and
requiring
more
assistance
with
his
activities
of
daily
living
.

He
also
developed
a
urinary
incontinence
.

He
had
had
two
falls
to
his
wife
&apos;s
recollection
,
both
times
slipping
off
the
edge
of
a
chair
backwards
.

On
the
morning
of
admission
at
8
o&apos;clock
,
he
was
noted
to
be
moving
his
mouth
less
and
speaking
&quot;
gibberish
&quot;
.

He
was
later
sitting
in
a
chair
making
multiple
attempts
to
get
up
,
which
he
subsequently
did
and
promptly
fell
directly
on
his
face
at
approximately
11:30
a.m.

There
was
no
definite
clonic
activity
.

There
was
no
known
incontinence
.

He
was
taken
to
an
outside
hospital
and
nasally
intubated
and
then
transferred
to
the
Ph
University
Of
Medical
Center
Emergency
Room
where
he
was
orally
intubated
.

A
trauma
evaluation
was
negative
and
thus
he
was
transferred
to
the
Neurology
Service
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
AND
TREATMENT
:

1)
NEUROLOGY
:

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
Neurology
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
intensive
monitoring
due
to
his
frail
condition
.

He
had
an
electroencephalogram
performed
on
his
initial
admittance
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
which
did
not
show
any
evidence
of
seizure
activity
.

It
did
,
however
,
show
diffuse
slowing
.

He
was
given

as
2
mgs
of
intravenous
Ativan
which
did
little
to
stop
his
rhythmic
blinking
that
he
showed
from
time
to
time
on
examination
.

His
hypertension
;
his
high
blood
pressure
was
controlled
with
intravenous
nitroglycerine
in
the
early
going
and
then
he
was
switched
to
an
oral
regimen
for
better
control
after
he
was
removed
from
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
.

He
continued
to
do
well
over
the
next
few
days
and
was
quite
surprisingly
intact
on
both
sides
of
his
body
in
terms
of
his
ability
to
move
.

He
did
consistently
have
more
movement
on
the
left
side
of
his
body
than
on
the
right
,
but
he
gradually
became
more
awake
and
alert
and
communicative
and
his
endotracheal
tube
was
removed
on
the
second
day
of
admission
.

His
diagnosis
of
progressive
supranuclear
palsy
was
placed
under
question
on
further
examination
of
his
eye
movement
since
he
was
able
to
have
excellent
superior
gaze
especially
with
the
bells
phenomenon
which
would
not
be
seen
with
progressive
supranuclear
palsy
.

It
was
felt
that
his
dementing
illness
and
rigidity
was
most
likely
due
to
some
type
of
cortico-basal
ganglia
degeneration
process
,
but
this
was
not
clarified
during
this
admission
.

It
was
not
felt
likely
to
be
due
to
Parkinson
&apos;s
disease
,
as
he
had
no
significant
response
to
Eldopa
in
the
past
and
the
patient
had
no
evidence
of
tremor
,
although
he
was
quite
rigid
and
bradykinetic
.

He
had
an
magnetic
resonance
imaging
performed
on
October
18
,
1996
.

This
showed
the
unchanged
left
temporal
parenchymal
interparenchymal
hematoma
and
the
old
embolic
right
frontal
infarct
,
but
there
were
no
new
lesions
and
no
evidence
of
his
susceptibility
studies
to
suggest
old
bleeds
which
might
have
been
consistent
with
amylase
angiopathy
.

In
addition
,
he
gadolinium
scan
did
not
show
enhancement
at
the
area
of
his
hemorrhage
,
so
tumor
was
felt
to
be
unlikely
.

However
,
this
issue
will
need
to
be
re-evaluated
in
six
months
time
once
the
hematoma
is
less
prominent
to
see
if
there
is
possibly
an
underlying
tumor
or
arterial
venous
malformation
that
could
be
currently
compressed
by
the
area
of
hemorrhage
.

The
etiology
of
his
bleed
was
felt
to
be
most
likely
secondary
to
hypertension
,
but
these
other
causes
could
also
not
be
ruled
out
.

2)
CARDIOVASCULAR
:

His
electrocardiogram
was
concerning
for
ischemia
.

He
was
on
intravenous
TNG
and
was
supratherapeutic
on
his
anti-coagulation
.

He
did
have
a
slight
elevation
of
his
TPK
with
an
additional
value
of
198
with
a
MB
fraction
of
5.7
,
which
makes
for
a
percentage
of
2.9
.

That
was
at
the
highest
percentage
that
he
had
and
after
this
his
percentage
came
down
to
1.6
,
1.0
on
subsequent
CKMBs
and
was
felt
that
he
had
a
very
small
&quot;
leaflet
&quot;
.

He
remained
chest
pain
free
throughout
his
admission
.

3)
PULMONARY
:

After
his
initial
intubation
he
remained
quite
stable
.

He
was
found
to
be
at
a
large
aspiration
risk
given
his
decreased
mental
status
and
the
lack
of
presence
of
a
gag
reflex
.

However
,
he
was
given
aggressive
pulmonary
toilets
including
chest
physical
therapy
and
aspiration
precautions
and
the
patient
did
not
develop
any
pulmonary
symptoms
during
his
admission
.

4)
HEMATOLOGY
:

He
had
his
prothrombin
time
reversed
with
Vitamin
K
2
mgs
on
admission
subcutaneously
as
well
as
two
units
of
fresh
frozen
plasma
given
in
the
emergency
room
.

His
anticoagulation
status
had
to
be
monitored
very
closely
due
to
his
history
of
deep
venous
thrombosis
and
pulmonary
embolus
as
well
as
atrial
fibrillation
,
but
he
could
not
be
placed
on
a
high
amount
of
anticoagulation
because
of
the
new
intraparenchymal
bleed
.

It
was
decided
that
his
goal
INR
was
to
be
2.0
.

He
did
drop
below
1.5
at
one
time
,
at
which
time
he
was
placed
on
heparin
intravenous
to
carry
him
through
that
period
,
but
his
discharge
INR
was
around
2
and
he
was
off
of
heparin
at
that
time
.

It
was
decided
that
he
would
have
very
close
monitoring
of
his
anticoagulation
status
in
the
future
to
prevent
further
problems
.

5)
GASTROINTESTINAL
:

He
was
evaluated
by
the
speech
and
swallow
pathology
group
at
the
Ph
University
Of
Medical
Center
and
it
was
decided
that
he
was
able
to
swallow
on
his
own
with
a
soft
solid
diet
with
supervision
.

Thus
,
his
nasogastric
tube
was
discontinued
on
October
19
,
1996
and
he
tolerated
feeding
quite
well
.

In
discussions
with
the
family
,
given
his
age
and
number
of
medical
problems
,
it
was
decided
that
the
patient
should
be
do
not
resuscitate
should
he
have
a
terminal
cardiac
event
during
his
admission
or
during
future
admissions
.

However
,
he
was
still
an
intubation
candidate
if
it
were
felt
to
be
a
short
term
procedure
.

The
family
realizes
that
the
long
term
outlook
for
this
patient
is
not
very
good
,
but
they
would
like
to
currently
continue
to
provide
him
with
all
support
necessary
,
short
of
resuscitation
measures
or
heroic
measures
should
he
have
a
cardiopulmonary
arrest
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
70-year-old
female
with
cryptogenic
cirrhosis
.

She
has
a
history
of
esophageal
varices
and
a
history
of
an
Upper
GI
bleed
.

She
has
had
one
pervious
episode
of
variceal
bleeding
with
an
unclear
date
.

However
she
is
followed
by
a
Dr.
Joasscchird
at
Vaila
Medical
Center
.

She
was
in
her
usual
state
of
health
until
one
day
prior
to
admission
when
she
felt
increasing
fatigue
,
nausea
and
vomiting
productive
of
bright
red
blood
and
coffee
ground
emesis
.

She
also
had
some
black
,
tarry
stool
in
her
colostomy
bag
.

At
Vaila
Medical
Center
,
she
had
a
hematocrit
of
25
and
was
transfused
2
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
.

She
had
an
upper
endoscopy
at
Va
Sit
Namar
Healthcare
showing
an
esophagus
filled
with
clots
and
small
amount
of
bleeding
varices
,
clot
in
the
stomach
with
antral
gastritis
,
and
a
normal
duodenum
.

She
was
started
on
Pitressin
,
a
Blakemore
tube
was
inserted
.

She
was
transferred
to
the
Ph
University
Of
Medical
Center
Intensive
Care
Unit
where
on
January
25
in
the
morning
her
hematocrit
was
found
to
be
27.4
.

She
was
transfused
another
2
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
over
the
course
of
the
day
and
her
hematocrit
improved
to
29.4
and
then
31.2
.

The
GI
service
was
consulted
and
an
upper
endoscopy
study
showed
grade
III
varices
with
no
active
bleeding
and
a
clean
base
gastric
ulcer
possibly
secondary
to
the
Blakemore
tube
.

Her
varices
had
stigmata
of
recent
bleeding
,
were
banded
successfully
.

after
the
procedure
and
2
more
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
,
the
patient
was
hemodynamically
stable
and
hematocrit
was
stable
at
31.2
.

At
that
time
she
was
transferred
from
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
to
Coden
2
for
the
Lemgarson
Hospital
service
.

and
her
platelets
were

.

PT
was
14.5
,
PTT

.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
AND
TREATMENT
:

As
described
above
the
patient
was
transfused
an
additional
2
units
in
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
and
the
patient
also
received
an
upper
endoscopy
study
and
her
varices
were
banded
.

On
transfer
to
the
Lemgarson
Hospital
service
,
her
hematocrit
was
31.2
,
white
count
11.1
and
a
platelet
count
80
.

Her
PT
was
13.1
,
PTT
26.7
.

The
rest
of
her
labs
were
unremarkable
.

She
was
watched
very
closely
while
on
the
floor
.

She
was
on
GI
bleed
precautions
at
all
times
,
was
too
large
for
IV
.

She
had
a
clot
at
the
blood
bank
and
she
had
BID
hematocrits
checked
.

She
was
kept
NPO
until
January
26
when
she
began
to
feel
hungry
.

At
that
time
clear
liquids
were
started
.

All
of
her
stools
were
guaiaced
.

She
also
began
Nadolol
40
mg
QD
to
reduce
her
portal
hypertension
.

The
GI
consult
team
continued
to
follow
her
.

We
also
tried
to
contact
her
physician
at
Va
Sit
Namar
Healthcare
and
was
unsuccessful
.

Therefore
we
decided
to
work
up
her
cirrhosis
.

She
was
described
as
having
_______
cirrhosis
and
we
decided
that
we
wanted
to
try
to
figure
out
the
etiology
.

Her
ferritin
and
iron
studies
did
not
reveal
any
evidence
of
hemochromatosis
and
her
hep
serologies
were
all
negative
.

She
also
had
negative
antimitochondrial
antibody
and
she
also
had
no
evidence
of
ceruloplasmin
.

Over
the
course
of
her
admission
were
also
sent
an
alpha-1-antitrypsin
,
which
was
negative
.

She
did
very
well
over
the
course
of
her
admission
with
no
evidence
of
further
bleeding
.

Her
hematocrit
stayed
stable
at
approximately
32
.

We
also
did
an
ultrasound
guided
paracentesis
.

The
peritoneal
fluid
showed
a
glucose
of
244
,
total
protein
0.8
and
a
albumin
of
0.5
,
globulin
0.3
,
amylase
16
,
LDH
of
51
.

The
serum
albumin
gradient
was
1.8
consistent
with
portal
hypertension
.

The
cell
count
showed
a
white
blood
cell
count
of
160
with
16%
polys
.

She
therefore
_________
criteria
for
a
spontaneous
bacterial
peritonitis
.

Her
platelet
count
stayed
persistently
low
and
we
decided
that
it
might
be
due
to
Cimetidine
.

Therefore
we
switched
her
Cimetidine
to
Prilosec
.

By
the
2th
the
patient
was
feeling
very
well
and
desired
to
transfer
or
discharge
to
home
.

She
wanted
to
be
closer
to
North
Dakota
.

After
discussion
with
her
private
physician
,
Dr.
Joasscchird
,
tel.
090-249-6079
,
at
Va
Sit
Namar
Healthcare
and
Dr.
Acrookesjo
at
Do
Of
Hospital
,
the
patient
was
judged
to
be
fit
for
discharge
and
she
was
sent
home
with
AH
and
physical
therapy
.

She
was
quite
able
to
climb
stairs
on
her
own
in
the
hospital
.

She
is
to
follow
up
with
Dr.
Acrookesjo
in
one
week
and
Dr.
Work
the
gastrointestinal
fellow
here
at
PUOMC
in
2
weeks
.

She
may
require
a
repeat
upper
endoscopy
study
to
see
if
she
needs
any
rebanding
.

The
patient
however
complained
of
a
persistent
wheeze
with
beta
blocker
,
therefore
it
was
agreed
that
we
would
stop
the
beta
blocker
until
the
patient
was
followed
up
as
an
outpatient
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
60-year-old
male
with
a
past
medical
history
notable
for
coronary
artery
disease
and
CABG
x2
in
2001
.

The
patient
has
felt
unwell
since
7/21
after
his
non-Q
wave
MI
.

The
patient
,
at
this
time
,
was
started
on
Statin
and
developed
in
arthritis
approximately
one
month
later
with
joint
pain
,
myalgia
and
fatigue
.

No
clear
diagnosis
was
made
.

The
patient
was
presumed
to
have
a
rheumatoid
factor
negative
,
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
he
was
prescribed
Naprosyn
,
prednisone
and
sulfasalazine
.

He
had
a
CABG
review
in
2/21
.

His
first
CABG
was
in
02/89
.

Since
2/21
,
he
has
had
increasing
weight
loss
of
30-49
pounds
,
night
sweats
which
he
attributed
to
the
prednisone
and
increased
fatigue
and
myalgias
.

The
patient
has
gradually
taken
to
bed
with
decreasing
activity
.

In
late
7/22
,
sulfasalazine
was
started
at
one
tab
three
times
a
day
.

The
patient
subsequently
developed
diffuse
abdominal
pain
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
and
decreased
p.o.
intake
.

A
guaiac
positive
stool
was
also
noted
in
the
month
of
July
.

10
days
prior
to
admission
,
the
patient
&apos;s
primary
care
physician
increased
his
sulfasalazine
dose
to
two
tabs
three
times
a
day
.

The
patient
&apos;s
prednisone
was
increased
to
60
mg
q.d.
as
the
patient
was
diagnosed
with
an
arthritis
flare
.

The
prednisone
dose
was
gradually
tapered
to
20
mg
q.d.

The
day
before
admission
,
the
patient
developed
a
fever
to
102
degrees
and
increasing
abdominal
pain
.

He
presented
to
an
outside
hops
where
he
was
noted
to
be
leukopenic
with
a
white
blood
cell
count
of
0.6
,
0
neutrophils
,
a
hematocrit
of
32
,
platelets
of
326
,
a
MCV
of
79
,
and
RDW
of
22
.

The
patient
was
given
IV
fluids
and
treated
with
imipenem
,
transferred
to
Ca
Valley
Hospital
ED
,
where
it
was
noted
that
the
patient
had
face
and
neck
swelling
,
as
well
as
erythema
and
cervical
lymphadenopathy
.

The
patient
states
that
his
swelling
of
his
face
began
two
days
prior
to
admission
and
has
doubled
since
then
.

In
the
emergency
department
,
CT
of
head
,
neck
and
abdomen
were
performed
.

The
CT
of
the
abdomen
was
without
lymphadenopathy
,
revealed
a
right
renal
cyst
,
otherwise
unremarkable
.

The
CT
of
head
and
neck
was
likewise
unremarkable
showing
no
evidence
of
fasciitis
or
deep
tissue
thread
.

No
abscesses
were
noted
.

,
with
a
normal
absolute
neutrophil
count
.

The
patient
&apos;s
chest
x-ray
at
the
outside
hospital
was
unremarkable
.

HOSPITAL
COURSE
:

The
patient
was
started
on
ceftazidime
,
nafcillin
and
Flagyl
for
concern
of
a
soft
tissue
infection
.

Neutropenic
precautions
were
taken
.

The
patient
had
a
bone
marrow
biopsy
which
showed
myeloid
arrest
and
probable
neutropenia
from
a
drug-related
cause
presumed
to
be
the
sulfasalazine
.

Over
the
course
of
the
hospitalization
,
the
patient
&apos;s
white
blood
cell
count
rose
from
0.4
to
6.3
after
he
was
given
G-CSF
,
a
course
lasting
from
9/28/01
until
9/30/01
.

After
the
G-CSF
,
the
absolute
neutrophil
count
was
greater
than
8000
.

On
10/3/01
,
the
patient
had
a
repeat
head
and
neck
CT
,
which
showed
a
right
parotitis
and
left
submandibular
lymphadenopathy
with
some
necrosis
.

No
frank
abscesses
.

The
patient
&apos;s
antibiotics
were
changed
to
clindamycin
300
mg
q.i.d.
and
patient
was
also
put
on
sialagogue
.

Over
the
course
of
the
hospitalization
,
the
swelling
and
tenderness
and
erythema
have
steadily
decreased
.

Recommendations
on
antibiotics
were
made
by
infectious
disease
team
,
who
was
consulted
.

Rheumatology
was
also
consulted
for
patient
and
after
workup
,
it
was
believed
that
arthritis
may
be
a
rheumatoid
factor
negative
,
rheumatoid
polyarthritis
.

Rheumatology
recommended
a
taper
of
his
prednisone
to
20
mg
q.d.
and
the
patient
will
be
followed
by
the
rheumatology
service
.

The
oncology
service
was
also
consulted
for
patient
and
performed
a
bone
marrow
biopsy
.

Throughout
his
course
during
this
hospitalization
,
the
patient
was
also
followed
by
the
ENT
service
.

The
ENT
physicians
did
not
recommend
any
procedures
,
incision
and
drainage
for
his
right
parotitis
or
left
submandibular
cervical
lymph
node
necrosis
.

The
ENT
team
recommended
watching
patient
in-house
for
two
days
after
his
repeat
imaging
on
10/3/01
,
and
to
continue
antibiotic
coverage
with
clindamycin
.

The
patient
had
no
positive
blood
cultures
during
his
hospitalization
and
remained
afebrile
after
the
second
day
of
admission
.

HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
:

The
patient
is
a
25
year
old
who
has
a
history
of
a
gunshot
wound
many
years
ago
and
has
had
multiple
surgical
procedures
since
then
.

Most
recently
he
was
admitted
to
an
outside
hospital
with
a
drug
overdose
in
adult
respiratory
distress
syndrome
and
ultimately
found
to
have
Candidal
pericarditis
which
eventually
led
to
constrictive
pericarditis
.

He
had
a
pericardial
window
.

He
had
a
barium
swallow
and
endoscopy
and
was
said
not
to
have
gastric
or
pericardial
ulcer
.

He
had
previous
substernal
gastric
bypass
because
of
an
interruption
of
his
esophagus
at
the
time
of
his
gunshot
wound
.

He
had
been
noted
to
have
an
ulcer
and
ultimately
when
he
stabilized
it
was
our
feeling
that
he
most
likely
had
a
gastric
pericardial
ulcer
and
he
was
transferred
here
for
further
management
.

We
discussed
the
risks
with
his
family
.

It
was
a
very
high
risk
in
very
poor
condition
and
a
cachectic
malnourished
edematous
individuals
who
have
very
high
venous
pressures
and
shortness
of
breath
.

The
family
understood
that
this
was
a
life
saving
procedure
and
only
carried
with
it
approximately
50%
chance
of
success
.

SPECIAL
PROCEDURES
AND
OPERATIONS
:

esophagoscopy
,
bronchoscopy
,
pericardectomy
,
excision
of
gastric
ulcer
,
repair
of
gastric
ulcer
and
pectoralis
major
myocutaneous
flap
performed
on
December
4
,
1995
by
Dr.
Reg
Cranka
and
Dr.
Win
Shufffyfe
.

In
lieu
of
a
standard
discharge
summary
given
this
patient
&apos;s
complicated
hospital
course
and
associated
illnesses
I
feel
it
best
to
just
provide
a
system
summary
concerning
this
patient
&apos;s
current
status
.

1.
Neurologic
and
Psychologic
:

The
patient
is
on
Nortriptyline
for
depression
.

He
is
a
paraplegic
from
T4
down
.

Otherwise
he
is
awake
,
alert
and
appropriate
and
can
respond
to
questions
and
can
move
his
upper
extremities
.

The
patient
however
spends
most
of
his
time
at
bedrest
due
to
decubiti
ulcer
disease
.

2.
Cardiac
:

The
patient
had
constrictive
pericarditis
that
was
relieved
by
his
surgical
procedure
.

He
had
a
cardiac
catheterization
on
December
1
,
1995
that
showed
no
complications
,
elevated
right
atrial
pressure
and
moderate
pulmonary
hypertension
.

The
cardiac
output
was
five
liters
per
minute
with
an
index
at
2.9
liters
per
minute
per
meter
2
which
is
normal
.

A
full
copy
of
the
cardiac
catheterization
report
is
enclosed
with
his
transfer
materials
.

The
patient
also
underwent
cardiac
ultrasound
on
December
11
,
1995
that
showed
abnormal
right
ventricle
wall
motion
,
trace
mitral
regurgitation
,
normal
left
ventricular
size
and
function
with
an
estimated
ejection
fraction
of
64%
.

There
is
Doppler
evidence
of
tricuspid
insufficiency
and
right
atrial
dilatation
.

There
is
trace
pulmonary
insufficiency
.

The
right
ventricle
is
dilated
and
diffusely
hypokinetic
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
constrictive
physiology
which
was
seen
on
December
6
,
1995
.

A
copy
of
this
ultrasound
is
also
found
in
his
records
.

The
patient
is
on
no
specific
medications
for
his
cardiac
condition
.

3.
Respiratory
:

the
patient
is
status
post
thoracotomy
and
has
staples
and
sutures
on
his
chest
.

These
may
be
removed
when
the
incisions
are
noted
to
be
well
healed
.

The
patient
is
approximately
three
weeks
following
his
procedure
and
several
of
these
stitches
will
be
removed
prior
to
discharge
.

The
patient
is
on
oxygen
by
face
mask
and
his
saturations
have
been
remaining
normal
.

His
medications
for
his
respiratory
system
are
Albuterol
nebulizer
0.5
mg.
2.5
cc.
q4hours
.

3.
GI
:

The
patient
has
had
gastric
ulcer
repair
and
also
has
a
colostomy
.

The
patient
has
a
sinus
tract
that
was
studied
with
a
fistulogram
on
December
25
,
1995
.

This
showed
no
communication
with
the
intestines
and
was
simply
a
sinus
tract
.

There
is
no
fistula
seen
.

Dr.
Asha
Vengloan
of
General
Surgery
consulted
on
the
patient
and
concluded
the
patient
does
not
require
any
surgical
treatment
of
this
problem
at
the
current
time
and
the
best
treatment
for
this
situation
would
be
to
increase
the
patient
&apos;s
nutrition
.

The
patient
takes
poorly
his
po.
diet
.

However
he
is
able
to
swallow
and
tolerate
po&apos;s
.

He
just
claims
to
